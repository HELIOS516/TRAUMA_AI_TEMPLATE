# Chalk Talk Development & Teaching Script – ADDIE-I9 Framework

## Phase 1: Analyze

- Define learners (junior, senior, mixed)
    
- General and targeted needs assessment (what's difficult or vital for this group?)
    
- Set a narrow, focused topic (diagnosis, guideline, management, or trial)
    

## Phase 2: Design

- Write SMART objectives for session (1 per 5 min; total 1–5)
    
- Prepare board map (two panels: before/after/sequence of diagrams, algorithms, or tables)
    

## Phase 3: Development

- Structure talking points linked to board; prepare question prompts; anticipate common learner responses
    
- Practice and prepare contingency plans
    

## Phase 4: Implementation (Gagné's Nine Events)

1. Gain Attention: open with a clinical case/issue
    
2. Inform Objectives: clear, visualized, tied to real patient care
    
3. Stimulate Recall: "Has anyone seen this? What's most confusing/difficult?"
    
4. Present Content: co-create board content interactively (criteria, algorithm, etc.)
    
5. Provide Guidance: scaffold reasoning, guide through critical thinking
    
6. Elicit Performance: case scenario or "walk through the algorithm"
    
7. Provide Feedback: clear, specific, actionable
    
8. Assess Performance: prompt immediate/near-future clinical application
    
9. Enhance Retention & Transfer: Board photo, highlight pearls, reinforce for future use
    

## Phase 5: Evaluation

- Gather quick learner feedback (was it useful? what remains unclear?)
    
- Save/iterate board maps & scripts
    

## Core Chalk Talk Elements (always include)

1. **Key Message/Punchline:** 1-sentence clinical headline
    
2. **Mnemonic:** Short, high-yield (e.g., "STORM" for PSH)
    
3. **Common Pitfalls/Misconceptions:** Errors in Dx/Mgmt
    
4. **Q&A or Roleplay:** Mini-scenario for interactive application
    
5. **Top Pearls for the Team:** 3 concise clinical tips
    
6. **Implementation Tips:** Checklist, EHR note, daily workflow
    
7. **Research Gaps & Future Directions:** What remains unknown/priorities
    
8. **References:** Numbered, cited in-text, include URLs for AI reference

**Instructions for Implementation in AI/SPACE:**

- For every new topic, use this template:
    
    1. Fill out all sections of the Journal Club Analysis Template using article summaries and URLs for source-tracing.
        
    2. Design a Chalk Talk following the ADDIE-I9 instructional steps, filling in all required "Core Chalk Talk Elements".
        
    3. Include at least 2–3 primary articles/guidelines with direct URLs for AI to reference/look up for current and future iterations.
        
    4. When practical, co-create board diagrams/algorithms/tables referenced in the instructions & share relevant Mnemonics/Pearls.
        
- All outputs should be clear markdown, ready for copying into a notes app, new AI prompt, or teaching file.
