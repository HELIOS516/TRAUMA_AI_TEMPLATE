## PART III: CLINICAL OVERVIEW SYNTHESIS

### SECTION 7: BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY

**[Topic Name]: Clinical Overview for Level 1 Trauma**

[Write 200-300 word executive summary incorporating:]

- Epidemiology (incidence, mortality, burden of disease)
- Clinical significance at your institution (from local data if available)
- Current practice landscape (variation/controversy highlighted)
- Role of trauma team (surgeons, ICU, neurology, etc.)
- Key clinical decision points
- Evidence-based management overview (1-2 sentences per major domain)

**Format Example:**

> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a leading cause of mortality and disability in trauma centers, accounting for approximately 50% of all trauma deaths. The pathophysiology involves primary mechanical injury (immediate) and secondary injury cascades (minutes to days) mediated by inflammation, ischemia, and excitotoxicity. Early recognition via validated assessment tools (Glasgow Coma Scale), rapid neuroimaging (non-contrast CT within 1 hour), and targeted interventions (ICP management, neuroprotection) significantly impact outcomes. Current evidence supports a tiered management approach: first-line noninvasive measures (head elevation, sedation, osmotic therapy per guidelines), second-line invasive monitoring (ICP catheter, brain tissue oxygenation) when thresholds exceeded, and third-line neurosurgical intervention (decompressive craniectomy) in select cases with refractory ICP elevation. Multidisciplinary coordination among trauma surgery, neurology, critical care, and operative teams is essential for optimal outcomes.

## PART VI: IMPLEMENTATION INTEGRATION WITH JOURNAL CLUB TEMPLATE

### SECTION 16: BRIDGE TO JOURNAL CLUB WORKFLOW

Once comprehensive topic overview created, integrate with existing Journal Club Template:

**Use This Topic Overview For:**

1. ☐ **Context for article-specific journal clubs:** "This systematic review [article] addresses a gap we identified: [specific gap from Section 8]"

2. ☐ **Pre-reading for residents:** Share comprehensive summary before article journal club

3. ☐ **Institutional protocol development:** Use algorithmic framework (Section 10) as basis for EHR orders

4. ☐ **Teaching rounds:** Deliver chalk talk using "Medium presentation" slides + ADDIE framework

5. ☐ **QI initiative:** Use Section 14 (resource requirements) to plan implementation

6. ☐ **Regular updates:** Quarterly review - update when new major RCT published or guideline revised

## PART VII: REUSABLE PROMPT FOR AI-ASSISTED COMPREHENSIVE TOPIC REVIEW

### Copy-Paste Prompt Template:

```
I need a COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE-BASED LITERATURE REVIEW AND CLINICAL OVERVIEW for the following trauma topic:

**Topic:** [INSERT SPECIFIC TRAUMA TOPIC, e.g., "Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Management in Adults" or "Damage Control Resuscitation in Polytrauma"]

**Clinical Context:** [Level 1 Trauma Center | Prehospital | ED | ICU - specify where this applies]

**Target Audience:** [PGY 3-5 Residents | Attending surgeons | Critical care team - specify]

Please use the COMPREHENSIVE TRAUMA TOPIC RESEARCH & EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS TEMPLATE and perform the following:

**PART I: EVIDENCE HIERARCHY FRAMEWORK**
- ☐ Identify and synthesize ALL major professional guidelines (ACS ATLS, EAST, WEST, ACCP, specialty-specific)
- ☐ Rate each using evidence hierarchy (Tier 1A → Tier 4)
- ☐ Create guideline comparison table highlighting consensus and disagreements
- ☐ Include search strategy: databases, terms, date range

**PART II: SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE COLLECTION**
- ☐ Systematic review/meta-analysis extraction table (if studies exist)
  - Include: # studies, total N, effect sizes (95% CI), GRADE ratings
- ☐ RCT extraction table (major trials only)
  - Include: sample size, population, intervention, control, primary outcome, results, applicability
- ☐ Evidence synthesis by clinical domain: [Diagnosis | Pathophysiology | Treatment | Complications]

**PART III: CLINICAL OVERVIEW SYNTHESIS**
- ☐ Brief summary (200-300 words): epidemiology, pathophysiology, management overview
- ☐ Patient phenotypes: presentation, imaging, biomarkers, prognosis, management per phenotype
- ☐ Diagnostic algorithm: visual flowchart with decision nodes
- ☐ Treatment framework: Tier 1 (first-line) → Tier 2 (second-line) → Tier 3 (surgical/advanced)
- ☐ Evidence-based recommendations: GRADE ratings for each domain
- ☐ Top 10 clinical pearls: each backed by specific guideline or meta-analysis
- ☐ Controversies & evidence gaps: what disagrees in literature? Why? What's unanswered?

**PART IV: CLINICAL OUTCOMES & RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**
- ☐ Outcomes by treatment tier (mortality, morbidity, disability-free survival from literature)
- ☐ Adverse events: % incidence, NNH from RCTs
- ☐ Resource requirements: personnel, equipment, training, cost
- ☐ Implementation barriers & facilitators (from QI/implementation science literature)

**PART V: GAMMA PRESENTATIONS**
Generate 3 evidence-based presentations:
- ☐ SHORT (16 slides, 15-20 min): Title, case, epidemiology, diagnosis, Tier 1 treatment, pearls, case application, takeaways
- ☐ MEDIUM (22-24 slides, 30-35 min): Add detailed epi table, biomarkers, imaging comparison, pathophysiology, outcomes data, Q&A
- ☐ LONG (30 slides, 45-60 min): Add implementation plan, multiple cases, medication reference, QI dashboard, research gaps

Formatting requirements for Gamma slides:
- Use markdown with pipe separators | for bullet points on same line
- Include specific data: OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.8), not "reduced risk"
- Use slide breaks --- after each slide
- Include GRADE ratings, evidence type, # of studies/RCTs
- Cite all sources: guideline names, PMID, DOI, or UpToDate URL

**REQUIREMENTS - EXCELLENCE STANDARD:**
✓ Fill every section with actual evidence data (no placeholders)
✓ Include exact numbers, percentages, effect sizes, 95% CIs, p-values
✓ Create tables with quantitative data from studies/guidelines
✓ Cite all sources: PMID/DOI/URL for guidelines and key trials
✓ Highlight controversies where guidelines/studies disagree
✓ Make clinical pearls immediately actionable for tomorrow's practice
✓ Evidence hierarchy respected: Tier 1A recommendations emphasized, Tier 4 de-emphasized
✓ High-level analysis appropriate for trauma/critical care audience
✓ Data-driven, evidence-based, medical excellence standard
✓ Acknowledge evidence gaps and uncertainties explicitly

**OPTIONAL: LOCAL DATA**
If you have local institutional data:
- TQIP metrics for this condition: [mortality %, LOS, complications %]
- Current practice variation (% using approach A vs. B)
- QI baseline metrics before/after implementation
```
