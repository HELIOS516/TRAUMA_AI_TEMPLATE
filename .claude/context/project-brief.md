# Project Brief

## What
Comprehensive AI-assisted system for trauma/surgical education: evidence synthesis templates (0-9), EPIC EHR attestation templates, and completed topic outputs. Version 3.0.

## Why
Medical educators need standardized, evidence-based workflows for creating presentations, literature reviews, journal clubs, and clinical documentation. Manual evidence synthesis is time-consuming and inconsistent.

## Scope
- 10 numbered template types (0-9) for evidence synthesis
- EPIC EHR attestation system (v2.0-v3.1) for attending billing
- 6+ completed topic syntheses with presentations
- Journal club and chalk talk templates
- Designed for Level 1 Trauma Centers, adaptable to any specialty
