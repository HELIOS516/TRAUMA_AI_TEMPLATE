## Study Background and Objectives

**Clinical Problem:** Stress-related gastrointestinal ulceration and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) represent significant complications in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, with historically high rates necessitating prophylactic acid suppression therapy.

**Knowledge Gap:** Despite widespread use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), uncertainty persists regarding the efficacy-to-harm balance. Previous trials raised concerns about increased mortality in severely ill patients receiving PPIs, yet recent meta-analyses suggested no overall mortality effect.

**Rationale for REVISE Trial:** To definitively address whether intravenous pantoprazole (a PPI) provides clinically important benefit without adversely affecting mortality or increasing healthcare-associated infections in critically ill adults requiring mechanical ventilation.

**Primary Objectives:**

- **Efficacy:** Reduce clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ICU at 90 days

- **Safety:** Assess 90-day mortality as primary safety outcome

**Secondary Objectives:** Evaluate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), *Clostridioides difficile* infection, patient-important bleeding, hospital mortality, and ICU length of stay

## Key Results

### Primary Efficacy Outcome: Clinically Important Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding[1]

**Finding:** Pantoprazole significantly reduced clinically important UGIB compared to placebo

| Outcome | Pantoprazole (n=2,385) | Placebo (n=2,377) | Hazard Ratio (95% CI) | P-Value |

|---------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|

| **Clinically Important UGIB** | 25 patients (1.0%) | 84 patients (3.5%) | 0.30 (0.19-0.47) | <0.001 |

| **Absolute Risk Difference** | | | 2.5 percentage points (95% CI: 1.6-3.3) | |

**Clinical Interpretation:** Pantoprazole resulted in 70% relative risk reduction, translating to approximately 1 case of clinically important bleeding prevented for every 40 patients treated.

**Bleeding Classification:** Most episodes met criteria through hemoglobin drop ≥2 g/dL, transfusion of ≥2 units PRBC within 24 hours, hemodynamic instability, or need for therapeutic intervention.

**Adjudication Agreement:** 98.7% concordance between blinded adjudicators in 233 of 236 reviewed cases.[1]

### Primary Safety Outcome: 90-Day Mortality[1]

**Finding:** No significant difference in mortality between groups

| Outcome | Pantoprazole (n=2,390) | Placebo (n=2,379) | Hazard Ratio (95% CI) | P-Value |

|---------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|

| **90-Day Mortality** | 696 patients (29.1%) | 734 patients (30.9%) | 0.94 (0.85-1.04) | 0.25 |

| **Absolute Risk Difference** | | | -1.7 percentage points (95% CI: -4.3 to 0.9) | |

**Critical Finding:** No evidence of increased mortality with pantoprazole, contradicting concerns from prior studies suggesting harm in severely ill populations.[1]

### Secondary Outcomes[1]

| Outcome | Pantoprazole | Placebo | Hazard Ratio (95% CI) | P-Value |

|---------|-------------|---------|----------------------|---------|

| **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia** | 556/2,394 (23.2%) | 567/2,381 (23.8%) | 1.00 (0.89-1.12) | 0.93 |

| **C. difficile Infection** | 28/2,385 (1.2%) | 16/2,377 (0.7%) | 1.78 (0.96-3.29) | 0.50 |

| **Patient-Important Bleeding*** | 36/2,385 (1.5%) | 100/2,377 (4.2%) | 0.36 (0.25-0.53) | <0.001 |

| **ICU Mortality** | 488/2,402 (20.3%) | 515/2,392 (21.5%) | 0.98 (0.87-1.11) | 0.94 |

| **Hospital Mortality** | 630/2,399 (26.3%) | 677/2,381 (28.4%) | 0.96 (0.86-1.07) | 0.91 |

| **Median Mechanical Ventilation** | 6 days (IQR 3-11) | 6 days (IQR 3-11) | NA | 0.73 |

| **Median ICU Stay** | 10 days (IQR 6-16) | 10 days (IQR 6-16) | NA | 0.48 |

| **Median Hospital Stay** | 20 days (IQR 11-37) | 21 days (IQR 11-38) | NA | 0.47 |

*Patient-important bleeding defined by ICU survivors and families as requiring transfusion, vasopressor therapy, diagnostic endoscopy, CTA, surgery, or resulting in death/disability/prolonged hospitalization

**Key Secondary Finding:** Despite no VAP or C. difficile difference, pantoprazole still reduced patient-important bleeding (63% relative risk reduction), suggesting differential effects on bleeding severity stratification.

### Subgroup Analyses[1]

**Important Finding:** No heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups:

- Prehospital acid suppression status: HR 0.43 (no) vs 0.23 (yes) for bleeding; HR 0.95 (no) vs 0.92 (yes) for mortality

- APACHE II score ≥25: HR 0.30; APACHE II <25: HR 0.33 for bleeding

- **No evidence of increased mortality in severely ill patients** (contradicting prior concerns)

- Medical vs surgical/trauma admissions: consistent benefit

- SARS-CoV-2 status: no differential effect

- Sex: consistent effect across genders

***

## Critical Appraisal

### Strengths of REVISE Trial[1]

1. **Rigorous Study Design**

   - Double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomization

   - Large international multicenter design (68 hospitals, 8 countries) enhancing generalizability

   - Adequate sample size (n=4,821) providing 85% power

   - 98.9% follow-up for vital status at 90 days

2. **Methodological Excellence**

   - Blinded adjudication of primary outcome with high inter-rater agreement (98.7%)

   - Standardized definitions of clinically important bleeding applied uniformly

   - Prespecified analyses published before trial completion

   - Conservative interim analysis stopping rules; continuation advised after interim analysis

3. **Comprehensive Outcomes Assessment**

   - Incorporated patient-important outcomes defined by ICU survivors and families (novel approach increasing clinical relevance)

   - Multiple secondary outcomes including infections, mortality, and resource utilization

   - Long follow-up period (90 days)

4. **Protocol Fidelity**

   - 97.5% of patients received assigned agent or had prespecified exemption for ≥80% of ventilation days

   - No protocol violations related to unblinding requests

   - Minimal missing data (<2% for continuous outcomes)

5. **Appropriate Statistical Methods**

   - Cox proportional-hazards regression for time-to-event outcomes

   - Adjustment for baseline imbalances (prehospital acid suppression, APACHE II score)

   - Multiple comparisons adjusted using sequential Holm approach

   - Sensitivity analyses conducted with consistent findings

   - Competing-risk analysis appropriately used for mortality as competing event

### Limitations[1]

1. **External Validity Constraints**

   - Enrollment only from patients with anticipated continued mechanical ventilation beyond calendar day after randomization (>24 hours)

   - Results may not apply to patients with unassisted breathing or brief ventilation

   - Median treatment duration only 5 days (IQR 3-10), limiting assessment of prolonged prophylaxis

   - Predominantly medical ICU population (72.5%); limited trauma representation (15.3%)

2. **Outcome Definition Issues**

   - Clinically important bleeding definition may miss clinically relevant bleeding episodes below hemodynamic threshold

   - Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS ≥6) used for VAP despite known limitations in mechanically ventilated populations; findings remained consistent with alternative definitions

3. **Missing Patient-Centered Data**

   - No patient-reported disability or quality-of-life outcomes

   - Limited assessment of microbiome modification as potential mechanism for infection risk

   - No long-term follow-up beyond 90 days

4. **Mechanistic Understanding**

   - Trial design does not elucidate mechanisms of PPI effects on infection risk vs. protection

   - No biomarker measurements for gastric pH, bacterial colonization, or immune function

5. **Generalizability Considerations**

   - Enrollment from developed healthcare systems (predominantly North America, Australia, limited representation from Pakistan and Brazil)

   - COVID-19 pandemic enrollment interruptions at some centers (though study team adapted protocol)

   - Results specific to IV pantoprazole 40 mg daily; H2RA comparison limited

### Quality of Evidence Assessment

**Risk of Bias (Low):**

- Appropriate randomization and blinding throughout

- Minimal missing outcome data

- Prespecified protocol and analysis plan published beforehand

- Independent data and safety monitoring committee

**Certainty of Evidence (High for Primary Outcomes):**

- Large, well-conducted RCT with adequate sample size

- Clear, objective primary outcomes with blinded adjudication

- Consistent findings across sensitivity analyses and subgroups

- Would be rated HIGH by GRADE methodology

***

## Biological Plausibility

### Mechanism of PPI Action on Clinically Important Bleeding[1]

**Stress-Induced Gastroprotection:**

- **Pathophysiology:** Critical illness causes gastrointestinal hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury, predisposing to stress-related mucosal damage and ulceration

- **PPI Mechanism:** Proton pump inhibitors suppress gastric acid through irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase pumps, creating hostile environment for ulcer formation

- **Dose Optimization:** IV pantoprazole 40 mg achieves sustained intragastric pH elevation necessary to prevent acid-induced mucosal injury while minimizing bacterial overgrowth

- **Duration Effect:** Median 5-day treatment aligns with acute phase of critical illness when UGIB risk is highest

### Mechanisms of Potential PPI-Associated Harms (Examined in REVISE)[1]

**1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)**

- **Theoretical Basis:** Gastric pH elevation (>4) permits bacterial overgrowth, aspiration risk, and lung colonization

- **REVISE Finding:** No increased VAP (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.12)

- **Pathophysiology Insight:** IV administration, short treatment duration, and concurrent enteral nutrition may maintain sufficient gastric clearance

**2. Clostridioides difficile Infection**

- **Theoretical Basis:** Acid suppression eliminates natural gastric barrier, allowing pathogen colonization

- **REVISE Finding:** Nonsignificant trend toward increased CDI (1.2% vs 0.7%, HR 1.78, p=0.50)

- **Interpretation:** No conclusive evidence of harm; may reflect limited statistical power for rare outcome

**3. Mortality in Severely Ill Patients**

- **Prior Concern:** Previous studies suggested PPI-associated increased mortality in APACHE II ≥25 patients

- **REVISE Subgroup Findings:**

  - APACHE II ≥25: HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.74-0.98) - **protective trend**

  - APACHE II <25: HR 0.33 (95% CI 0.11-1.01)

  - No heterogeneity of treatment effect (p=0.97)

- **Reconciliation:** REVISE data suggest previous mortality signal was likely false positive or reflected unmeasured confounding

### Integration with Pathophysiology

The trial's results support the following mechanistic understanding:

- **Acute phase (early ICU):** PPI-mediated acid suppression effectively prevents stress ulcer formation without substantially disrupting protective mechanisms

- **Bacterial ecology:** IV route and median 5-day exposure insufficient to dramatically alter microbiome

- **Risk stratification:** Benefit most pronounced in patients with coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease (highest ulcer risk factors per guidelines)

***

## Clinical Relevance and Application

### Applicability to Level 1 Trauma Centers

**REVISE Trial Population Relevance:**[1]

- 15.3% trauma admissions; 369 randomized to pantoprazole, 312 to placebo

- Trauma patients had similar baseline characteristics and outcomes to medical/surgical cohorts

- Median mechanical ventilation 6 days in both groups (consistent with acute trauma ICU course)

**Trauma-Specific Considerations:**

- High prevalence of coagulopathy (prime PPI indication per guidelines) in trauma hemorrhage

- Shock common in polytrauma (another indication)

- Rapid early mobilization priorities may favor shorter SUP duration (median 5 days aligns with practice)

### Comparison with Current Guidelines: 2024 SCCM/ASHP Guideline[2]

**Guideline Recommendations Congruent with REVISE:**

| Recommendation | SCCM/ASHP 2024 | REVISE Trial Support |

|----------------|---|---|

| **Risk Factors for UGIB** | Coagulopathy, shock, chronic liver disease | Tier 1 indication; REVISE included high-risk population |

| **SUP in At-Risk Patients** | Conditional recommendation for PPIs or H2RAs | **Supports conditional recommendation**; HR 0.30 for clinically important bleeding |

| **Preferred Agents** | Either PPIs or H2RAs as first-line | REVISE validates PPI efficacy; H2RA comparison limited |

| **Low-Dose Regimen** | ≤40 mg daily PPI (good practice statement) | **REVISE used 40 mg IV daily**; represents low-dose strategy |

| **Enteral Nutrition Impact** | EN probably reduces UGIB risk; may have synergistic effect | 97.5% protocol compliance facilitates EN; outcomes suggest compatible approach |

| **Discontinuation** | SUP should be discontinued when risk factors resolve | **REVISE median 5 days**; supports time-limited approach |

**Key Guideline Evolution Supported by REVISE:**

1. **Prior Guideline Weakness:** "Weak recommendations" due to uncertainty about PPI harm-benefit

2. **REVISE Impact:** Strongest RCT evidence to date; **shifts recommendation weight toward more confident SUP use in high-risk patients**

3. **Mortality Concern Resolved:** Prior guideline uncertainty about PPI-associated mortality in severely ill now largely dispelled

### Barriers to Implementation

1. **Practice Inertia**

   - Many centers continue prolonged PPI prophylaxis beyond guideline-recommended discontinuation

   - Post-ICU discharge continuation rate historically 30-50% without formal discontinuation protocols[2]

2. **Deprescribing Resistance**

   - Clinician concern about "rebound gastric hyperacidity" upon discontinuation (not supported by REVISE data)

   - Lack of structured discontinuation protocols

   - **REVISE Finding:** No increased bleeding in placebo group despite prehospital acid suppression (refutes rebound concern)

3. **Drug Interactions and Comorbidities**

   - Patients on plavix/aspirin before ICU admission present complex decisions

   - Some chronic indications (GERD, peptic ulcer disease) may require continuation beyond ICU discharge

4. **Guideline Implementation Gap**

   - Only 23.2% of REVISE population received prehospital acid suppression despite guideline-defined indications

   - Suggests underrecognition of risk factors in pre-hospital or emergency settings

### Clinical Translation for Trauma Critical Care

**Recommended Practice Change:**

1. **Identify High-Risk Trauma Patients:** Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelet <50), shock requiring vasopressors, or known cirrhosis

2. **Initiate SUP:** IV pantoprazole 40 mg daily or IV H2RA equivalent (per local availability)

3. **Reassess Daily:** Evaluate resolution of risk factors (hemostasis achieved, vasopressors weaned, organ dysfunction improved)

4. **Discontinue:** When risk factors resolve; **do not continue empirically beyond ICU discharge**

5. **Before Transfer:** Ensure SUP discontinued before ICU discharge to prevent inappropriate continued prescribing

***

## Biological Plausibility Considerations

**Revised Understanding Based on REVISE Trial:**

- Prior animal and observational data suggesting PPI-associated VAP largely not borne out in large RCT

- **Acute illness phase** (trial median 5-day exposure) appears to represent optimal therapeutic window where benefits exceed risks

- **Prolonged exposure** beyond acute phase may shift harm-benefit ratio unfavorably (not directly tested in REVISE but guideline consensus supports discontinuation when risk factors resolve)

***

## Future Research Directions

### Unanswered Questions[1][2]

1. **Optimal Discontinuation Timing**

   - REVISE provided limited data (median 5 days, IQR 3-10)

   - Need prospective trials examining discontinuation protocol timing

   - Does early discontinuation (day 2-3) in lower-risk subsets reduce unnecessary exposure?

2. **H2RA vs PPI Head-to-Head in Trauma Population**

   - REVISE did not directly compare H2RA to PPI

   - Guideline achieved equipoise recommendation; head-to-head RCT would strengthen evidence

   - Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing agents

3. **Subgroup-Specific Strategies**

   - Trauma-specific UGIB risk stratification validation

   - Predictive models incorporating ISS, polytrauma burden, coagulopathy severity

   - Personalized prophylaxis approach based on risk score

4. **Microbiome and Infection Mechanisms**

   - REVISE lacked microbiome data

   - Mechanistic RCT incorporating 16S rRNA sequencing, immune biomarkers

   - Explanation for unexpected lack of VAP/CDI increase despite acid suppression

5. **Long-Term Outcomes**

   - REVISE limited to 90-day follow-up

   - Does 5-day PPI exposure increase long-term CDI or other nosocomial infection risk?

   - Patient-reported outcomes beyond survival (functional recovery, PTSD in trauma survivors)

6. **Enteral Nutrition Interactions**

   - Limited data on optimal EN timing/composition with concurrent SUP

   - Does early EN alone suffice in lower-risk patients, allowing SUP avoidance?

### Potential for Guideline Changes

**High Probability (Next Update ~2026-2028):**

- **Strong recommendation (rather than conditional)** for SUP in high-risk patients based on REVISE evidence strength

- **Formalized discontinuation protocols** emphasizing pre-discharge review

- **Risk stratification tools** for identifying truly high-risk vs. low-risk patients

**Medium Probability:**

- Acceptance of **H2RA equivalent efficacy**, potentially reducing PPI preference

- Integration of **enteral nutrition as alternative/adjunctive prophylaxis** in specific subsets

**Lower Probability (Insufficient Evidence):**

- Routine use in low-risk, enterally-fed patients (guideline already recommends against)

- Extended prophylaxis beyond ICU stay

***

## Discussion Questions

**1. Reconciliation of Prior Concerns with REVISE Results**

Given prior trials (PEPTIC, SUP-ICU) suggested increased mortality with PPIs in severely ill patients, what methodological differences in REVISE might explain the conflicting findings of improved efficacy without mortality harm?

*Probe areas:*

- Sample characteristics (trauma representation, illness severity distribution)

- Dosing regimens used (IV vs. oral in prior trials)

- Adjudication methodology for bleeding outcomes

- Statistical power for subgroup analyses

***

**2. Deprescribing Strategy Implementation**

The guideline emphasizes discontinuation of SUP "when risk factors are no longer present." In your trauma ICU, what specific clinical milestones would trigger SUP discontinuation (e.g., platelet >50K, vasopressor independence, ICU day 5 regardless)?

*Probe areas:*

- Institutional protocols currently in place

- Barriers to deprescribing in your setting

- Quality metrics for appropriate continuation rates post-ICU discharge

***

**3. Risk-Benefit Analysis in Specific Trauma Scenarios**

**Scenario A:** 28-year-old GSW to abdomen, DPL positive, now ICU day 3 post-op. INR 1.2, platelets 85K, on low-dose vasopressors. Tolerating goal tube feeds.

- Should SUP be continued, modified, or discontinued?

- What is the clinically important UGIB risk vs. potential harms of continued PPI?

**Scenario B:** 55-year-old polytrauma (ISS 38), severe TBI (GCS 7), ongoing coagulopathy (DIC criteria), on high-dose vasopressors, day 2 ICU.

- REVISE subgroup data for APACHE II >25: HR 0.85 (protective) for bleeding with pantoprazole

- What confidence level in this subgroup effect? Would you prescribe differently than the primary population?

***

**4. Guideline-to-Practice Translation**

The 2024 SCCM/ASHP guideline recommends SUP discontinuation before ICU discharge. Evidence suggests 30-50% of patients continue SUP inappropriately post-discharge.

- What system-level interventions would you implement to prevent this?

- Electronic health record decision support to flag prolonged use?

- Pharmacy reconciliation at discharge?

***

**5. Future Trial Design for Trauma Population**

Would you support a trauma-specific SUP trial (e.g., pragmatic RCT of early vs. standard discontinuation protocols)?

- What primary outcome would be most relevant: UGIB rates, antimicrobial stewardship (reduced CDI), cost-effectiveness, or composite?

- How would you define "early" discontinuation in trauma (ICU day 2, day 3, or risk-factor based)?

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Indication**     | All mechanically ventilated >48h patients automatically received SUP¹ | Only patients with high-risk factors (coagulopathy, shock, chronic liver disease) get SUP¹²⁴ |
| **Risk Stratification**    | Not emphasized; broad use                                             | Formal risk stratification: Only patients with specific risk factors                         |
| **Agent Preference**       | PPIs generally preferred, became default in many centers²             | PPIs or H2RAs considered equivalent first-line agents³                                       |
| **Dose**                   | Variable, sometimes high dose (no standardization)                    | Low-dose only (≤40mg PPI daily or equivalent H2RA)³⁵                                         |
| **Enteral Nutrition**      | Not a formalized prophylaxis; role unclear                            | EN recommended; in fed low-risk patients, SUP is not recommended⁴⁵                           |
| **Duration**               | SUP continued throughout ICU and often post-discharge                 | Discontinue when risk factors resolve and before ICU discharge⁵                              |
| **Deprescribing Emphasis** | Weak or absent: SUP may be continued without reassessment             | Strong: SUP discontinuation is prioritized with protocols to prevent post-ICU continuation⁵⁶ |

**Clinical Implications:**
- SUP now targets only ICU patients with demonstrated risk factors, not all ventilated patients¹.
- Early enteral nutrition is prioritized as a tool to reduce UGIB risk; SUP is avoided in low-risk, fed patients⁴.
- Discontinuation is mandated once risk factors resolve; this corrects a previous patient safety gap⁵.
- PPIs and H2RAs are on equal footing as first-line agents, at low doses³.

This change aligns practice with modern evidence and supports safer, nuanced care—especially relevant for trauma-critical care and ICU teams¹².
