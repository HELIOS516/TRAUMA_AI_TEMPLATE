## SECTION 1: EPIDEMIOLOGY & BURDEN OF DISEASE

### Global Disease Burden (2017 Global Burden of Disease Study)[38][45]
- **Annual incidence**: 7.5 million facial fractures (95% UI: 6.1–9.5 million) globally
- **Age-standardized incidence rate**: 98 per 100,000 (80–123 range)
- **Prevalence**: 23 per 100,000 (20–27 range)
- **Years lived with disability (YLDs)**: 2 per 100,000 (1–2 range)
- **Leading causes**: Fall injuries (most common globally); RTAs; assault/violence; sports

### United States Epidemiology (2025 Data)[40][48]
- **National incidence**: 40.57 per 100,000 person-years
- **Gender disparity**: Males 45.47/100,000; females 35.1/100,000; male-to-female IRR 1.27
- **Age distribution**: Bimodal peak—ages 20–29 (youth sports/assault) AND ages 80+ (falls); elderly 80+ years: 186.57/100,000 (18.7x baseline)
- **Trend**: Sports-related facial fractures increasing; overall incidence stable since 1990

### Anatomic Distribution[42][54]
| Fracture Site | Frequency | Infection Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mandibular** | 35% | Highest (8.9% pooled) | Dentate region = open; oral flora exposure |
| **Zygomatic (malar)** | 24% | Low (0.9% pooled) | Closed; skin flora only |
| **Nasal** | 23% | Very low (<1%) | Minimal soft tissue |
| **LeFort (maxillary)** | 8% | Low | Sinus flora; non-oral |
| **Orbital** | 6% | Very low (0.5%) | Closed; neurovascular |
| **Multiple** | 27.6% | Variable | Cumulative risk |

### Etiology & Demographics[42][54]
- **Age peak**: 20–40 years (87% of cases)
- **Gender**: 85% male
- **Mechanism priority**: Falls (most common globally, 40–60% in developed nations); RTAs (24–70%, varies by region); assault (22–41%); sports (9%, increasing)
- **Pediatric considerations**: 5–15% of all facial fractures are in children <16 years; better healing, lower infection risk

### Mortality Risk by Fracture Location[44]
| Fracture Type | Cumulative Mortality | RR of Death | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upper face** (orbital, frontal, ethmoid) | 18.8% | 4.06 fold ↑ | Associated with intracranial injury (4–6x) |
| **Middle face** (LeFort, zygomatic) | 6.9% | 1.7 fold ↑ | Moderate TBI risk |
| **Lower face** (mandible) | 4.0% | Baseline | Lowest mortality |

**Implication**: Upper face fractures mandate CT head evaluation for occult TBI even with normal GCS.

## SECTION 2: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & MECHANISM OF INJURY

### Temporal Evolution of Fracture-Associated Infection

**Phase 1: Immediate Injury (0–6 hours)**
- Traumatic disruption of soft tissue, bone, mucosa
- Exposure of cancellous bone (high bacterial affinity)
- Blood clot formation; immediate hemostasis
- Inflammatory mediator release: IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α (peak 3–4 hours post-injury)
- Bacterial inoculation: Environmental + host flora depending on wound type
- **Antibiotic window opens**: PMN recruitment beginning; complement/antibody opsonization of pathogens starts
- **Clinical relevance**: Prophylactic antibiotics most effective WITHIN 1–2 hours of injury or incision

**Phase 2: Early Inflammatory Response (6–24 hours)**
- Neutrophil infiltration maximal by 12–24 hours
- Biofilm formation initiates on fracture surfaces and foreign material (if ORIF planned)
- **For mandibular/oral fractures**: Oral flora (*Streptococcus*, *Prevotella*, *Peptostreptococcus*, anaerobes) colonize wound; transition from transient to adherent bacteria
- Early fibroblast proliferation and cytokine signaling
- Macrophage infiltration; antigen presentation begins
- **Therapeutic window closes**: Beyond 24 hours, biofilm maturation and antibiotic tolerance increase; prophylaxis less effective
- **Clinical relevance**: Prophylactic duration ≤24 hours optimal; prolongation shows no benefit and increases risk

**Phase 3: Progressive Infection Risk (24 hours–2 weeks)**
- Biofilm maturation; bacterial metabolic shift from planktonic to sessile phenotype
- Increased antibiotic tolerance (10–100x higher MICs in biofilms)
- Enhanced exopolysaccharide production; mechanical protection from PMN kill
- Osteoclast activation (RANKL/RANK signaling); bone resorption begins (risk of osteomyelitis)
- Fibroblast extracellular matrix deposition; impaired vascular invasion
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Delay in surgical treatment dramatically increases infection risk:
  - **<24 hours**: 4.2% infection rate
  - **>7 days**: 55% infection rate (12-fold increase)[49]
- **Clinical relevance**: Early surgical intervention more important than antibiotic duration; antibiotics cannot compensate for delayed surgery

**Phase 4: Chronic Infection & Sequelae (>2 weeks–months)**
- Established osteomyelitis: Sequestrum formation, cortical sclerosis, necrotic bone isolation
- Non-union risk: Disrupted fracture callus; impaired healing due to infection/inflammation
- Chronic drainage, sinus tract formation, fistulization
- Biofilm-encased bacteria require weeks–months of IV therapy (if therapeutic antibiotics indicated)
- **Clinical relevance**: Prophylaxis should have already been discontinued; now managing established infection, not prophylaxis

### Fracture Type-Specific Pathophysiology

**Mandibular Fractures (Dentate Regions: Angle, Body, Symphysis, Parasymphysis)**
- **Status**: Presumed OPEN (communication to oral cavity via periodontium)
- **Flora**: Mixed anaerobic + aerobic; oral cavity residents (*Prevotella*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Porphyromonas*, *Fusobacterium*, *Streptococcus*, *S. aureus*)
- **Infection rate**: 8.9% pooled (highest among facial fractures; historically 43.9% without prophylaxis per Chole 1987 RCT)
- **Mechanism**: Direct intraoral communication; saliva contamination; poor vascularization at angle/symphysis (Hueston's areas)
- **ORIF vs. closed**: ORIF 4-fold higher infection risk vs. closed reduction + MMF (mandibular-specific)

**Mandibular Fractures (Non-Dentate Regions: Condylar, Coronoid)**
- **Status**: Closed (no oral communication); debated whether prophylaxis needed
- **Flora**: Skin flora only
- **Infection rate**: <1%
- **Management**: Many trauma centers do NOT give prophylaxis for closed/non-operative condylar fractures; SIS recommends against

**Midfacial Fractures (LeFort I/II/III, Zygomatic, Orbital)**
- **Status**: Closed unless intraoral laceration present
- **Flora**: Sinus flora (*Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, anaerobes from paranasal sinuses) + skin flora
- **Infection rate**: 0.9% pooled (very low baseline; RCTs show 0–4% with/without prophylaxis)
- **Advantage**: Excellent blood supply to midface (angular/infraorbital/superior alveolar vessels) → superior immune response
- **Clinical relevance**: Single perioperative dose may suffice; no evidence for ≤24h vs. single-dose (Campos 2015: 4.4% vs. 4.1%, not significant)

**Upper Face Fractures (Frontal Bone, Nasofrontal, Supraorbital)**
- **Status**: Closed; potential CSF communication if posterior table involved
- **Flora**: Sinus flora + paranasal contamination
- **Infection rate**: <1% (excellent prognosis)
- **Special consideration**: Posterior table fractures → dural violation risk; some protocols extend to 24h (though evidence limited)

**Posterior Table Frontal Sinus Fractures**
- **Unique feature**: Potential intracranial space exposure; CSF leak possible
- **Flora**: Normal meningeal organisms (*S. pneumoniae*, *N. meningitidis*, *Haemophilus*) if CSF leak; sinus flora if sealed
- **Meningitis risk**: ~1% even without prophylaxis (Cochrane meta-analysis: prophylactic AB does NOT reduce meningitis incidence)[62]
- **AAST recommendation**: ≤24h antibiotics (though mechanism of benefit unclear; likely local source control more important)
- **CNS penetration**: Some institutions prefer ceftriaxone (3rd-gen, better CSF levels) over cefazolin (1st-gen, poor penetration); no RCT comparison

**Basilar Skull Fractures with CSF Leak**
- **Cochrane meta-analysis** (5 RCTs): NO reduction in meningitis incidence with/without prophylactic antibiotics[62]
- **Meningitis incidence**: ~10% baseline; unchanged by prophylaxis (range across studies 3–21%)
- **Mechanism failure**: CSF-immune privilege (antibodies, complement less effective in CSF); inadequate CNS penetration of prophylactic agents; lack of blood-brain barrier integrity
- **Current guideline**: AAST/SIS STRONG recommendation AGAINST prophylactic antibiotics
- **Management**: Focus on early repair, CSF isolation, neurosurgical consultation

## SECTION 3: CURRENT GUIDELINES (ALL MAJOR SOCIETIES)

### AAST Critical Care Committee 2024 Clinical Consensus[2][3]
**Most recent, comprehensive guideline (Level 1 Trauma Centers)**

| Clinical Scenario | Antibiotic Class | Duration | Grade | Evidence Base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open/Contaminated Facial Fractures** (posterior table frontal sinus, open mandible, visible contamination) | Cefazolin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin/sulbactam, Clindamycin (allergy) | ≤24h post-op | Weak | 2 RCTs + meta-analyses |
| **Closed/Non-Contaminated Operative Facial Fractures** (upper 1/3, midfacial LeFort, zygomatic, non-dentate mandible, orbital) | Cephalosporin 1st/3rd-gen (pre-op only) | ≤1h before incision | Weak | Observational; expert consensus |
| **Non-Operative Facial Fractures** (closed, managed conservatively) | None | N/A | Weak Against | 2 small RCTs; 0% infection all groups |
| **Facial/Scalp Lacerations (simple)** | None | N/A | Weak Against | Observational; low baseline risk |
| **Facial/Scalp Lacerations (through-and-through, high-risk)** | Amoxicillin-clavulanate, Clindamycin | ≤24h | Weak | Expert consensus; limited data |
| **Mammalian Bites (face)** | Amoxicillin-clavulanate 3–5 days; Clindamycin + TMP-SMX | 3–5 days | Moderate | Observational; established practice |
| **Basilar Skull Fractures ± CSF Leak** | None | N/A | **Strong Against** | Cochrane meta-analysis (5 RCTs) |
| **Pneumocephalus** | None | N/A | **Strong Against** | Observational; expert consensus |
| **Penetrating TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury)** | Cefazolin, Clindamycin ± Metronidazole (contaminated) | <3 days | Weak | Systematic review; conflicting |
| **Penetrating Spine Injury (Gunshot, low-velocity)** | Cephalosporin, Ampicillin/sulbactam, Piperacillin/tazobactam | ≤48h | Weak | AAST extrapolation; limited direct evidence |

**Key AAST Definitions**:
- **Prophylactic AB**: Administered >1h before surgery or >2h for vanc/fluoroquinolones
- **Perioperative AB**: Within 1h of incision, no >24h post-op
- **Postoperative AB**: Continued >24h post-op (NOT recommended for facial fractures)

---

### Surgical Infection Society (SIS) 2021 Guideline[28][37]
**GRADE-Rated Recommendations (Most rigorous methodology)**

| Recommendation | GRADE Strength | Evidence Quality | Population |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-operative facial fractures: NO prophylactic AB** | **Strong** | Low | Includes mandible, maxilla, orbital, all sites |
| **Operative non-mandibular fractures: NO pre-op AB; NO post-op AB** | **Strong** | Low | Upper 1/3, midface, LeFort, zygomatic |
| **Operative mandibular fractures: NO pre-op AB** | **Strong** | Low | Controversy: contradicts some practice; weak evidence |
| **Operative mandibular fractures: NO post-op (>24h) AB** | **Strong** | **Moderate** | Best-supported recommendation; multiple RCTs concordant |
| **Open/contaminated fractures: ≤24h AB acceptable** | Weak | Low | Limited RCT data; extrapolation from extremity fractures |

**SIS Rationale for Strong Recommendations Against Prophylaxis**:
- Non-operative fractures: 0% infection in ALL groups (no AB, 1–5d, >5d) in Malekpour RCT
- Operative fractures: No evidence superiority of pre-op AB vs. no AB (vs. extremity fracture patterns where pre-op shown beneficial)
- Against prolongation: Multiple RCTs show prolongation ≥72h increases SSI vs. <24h (meta-analysis OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08–2.46)

---

### EAST (Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma) Practice Management Guidelines
**Status**: No dedicated facial fracture guideline (2021 status); focus on extremity fractures & abdominal trauma

**Relevant EAST Recommendations** (Extrapolated to Facial Trauma):
- **Open Fractures**: Single preoperative prophylactic dose + gram-positive coverage ≤1h before incision[63]
- **Type III Gustilo fractures**: Add gram-negative coverage (aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone)
- **Duration**: No post-op prophylaxis without hollow viscus injury
- **Fluoroquinolones**: NOT recommended for routine prophylaxis (Level 1 evidence against); no advantage vs. cephalosporin/aminoglycoside; may impair healing

**EAST does NOT address facial trauma specifically**—facial fractures differ from extremity (better blood supply, different flora, lower baseline infection).

---

### ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) 10th Edition
**Status**: General trauma principles; facial fractures discussed in Musculoskeletal Trauma section

**ATLS Principles on Facial Fractures**:
- Recognition of life threat (airway, cervical spine, TBI)
- Assessment of facial soft tissue and hard tissue injury
- Identification of open/contaminated vs. closed fractures
- **On antibiotics**: ATLS defers to specialty guidelines (AAST, SIS); no dedicated ATLS prophylaxis recommendations

**ATLS does NOT provide antibiotic-specific guidance for facial fractures**—Level 1 Trauma Centers rely on AAST/SIS.

---

### ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians) & Sepsis Guidelines
**Status**: Sepsis management, NOT prophylaxis; focused on treatment of established infection

**ACCP Relevance to Trauma Prophylaxis**:
- Early antibiotics for sepsis (within 1h) recommended
- NOT prophylaxis-specific; addresses therapeutic dosing for bacteremia/septic shock
- Does NOT address trauma prophylaxis or facial fractures

---

### Institutional Protocols (Representative Examples)

**Vanderbilt University Medical Center (2024)**[17]
- **Open facial fractures**: Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h × 3 doses (~18h) OR pre-op + 1–2 post-op doses
- **Posterior table frontal sinus**: Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h × 3 doses (preferred for GN/anaerobic coverage)
- **Closed operative**: Perioperative dose only (cefazolin or ampicillin/sulbactam)
- **Non-operative**: None
- **Allergy protocol**: Clindamycin 600mg q6h × 3 or vancomycin

**UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) Protocol (2024)**[11]
- **Open mandible**: Ancef (cefazolin) 2g IV q8h × 24h + metronidazole 500mg q8h × 24h
- **Posterior table frontal sinus**: Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h × 24h (CNS penetration emphasis)
- **Basilar skull CSF leak**: Ceftriaxone until repair + 5d post-op OR until CSF resolves (more conservative than AAST)
- **Non-operative**: No prophylaxis

## SECTION 4: DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH & DECISION CRITERIA AT LEVEL 1 TRAUMA CENTER

### Initial Assessment Flow (ED Arrival)

**Step 1: ABCDE Stabilization**
- **Airway**: Secure if risk of obstruction (facial swelling, blood, soft palate collapse); consider early intubation if extensive maxillofacial trauma
- **Breathing/Circulation/Disability**: Standard ATLS primary survey
- **Expose**: Full facial inspection for lacerations, asymmetry, crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema = fracture communication to sinus/oral cavity)

**Step 2: Mechanism Assessment**
| Mechanism Type | Fracture Pattern | Contamination Assumption | Prophylaxis Need |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Blunt, low-energy (fall <10ft, punch)** | Closed fracture | Clean | NO prophylaxis (operative only) |
| **Blunt, high-energy (MVA, motorcycle crash)** | Often comminuted; assess for lacerations | Closed UNLESS laceration present | Consider contaminated IF visible wound |
| **Penetrating (GSW, stab)** | Open fracture | Contaminated | YES, ≤24h |
| **Bite wound (human/animal)** | Rare; if fracture present | Dirty | YES, 3–5d |
| **Industrial/crush injury** | Often comminuted + open | Contaminated | YES, ≤24h |

**Step 3: Visual Inspection for Open Wound**
- **Presence of laceration**:
  - Over fracture site + communication to mouth = OPEN FRACTURE → mandate prophylaxis ≤24h
  - Over fracture site + closed wound = Debatable (some surgeons prophylax; AAST/SIS recommend against for non-oral)
  - Simple laceration, no fracture = Per laceration guidelines (usually NO prophylaxis unless high-risk)
  
- **Visible contamination** (blood, dirt, food, saliva):
  - If mandible angle/body/symphysis with visible intraoral wound = OPEN → prophylaxis ≤24h
  - If non-oral region (zygoma, upper face) with visible contamination = Borderline; many use ≤24h empirically

- **Intraoral examination** (after C-spine cleared):
  - Gingival tear at fracture line = Communication to oral cavity = Open fracture
  - Dental malocclusion = Likely mandibular fracture (open if dentate)
  - Sublingual/buccal ecchymosis = Soft tissue trauma; assess tooth roots at fracture

### Imaging & Diagnostic Decisions

**CT Face (Axial & Coronal Planes)**
- **Fracture classification**: Site (mandible vs. midface vs. upper), complexity (simple vs. comminuted), displacement
- **Open fracture identification**: 
  - Intraoral laceration visible? (May not see on CT; clinical exam more sensitive)
  - Soft tissue defect crossing fracture line?
  - Gas in soft tissues? (Indicates communication to sinus/mouth)
- **Associated injuries**:
  - Posterior table frontal sinus involvement? (Dural tear risk)
  - Basilar skull fracture? (CSF leak concern)
  - Cervical spine fracture? (C-spine imaging needed)
  - Orbital fracture with entrapment? (Urgency indicator)

**Head CT** (If GCS <15 OR upper/midface fracture)
- Rule out epidural/subdural hematoma, SAH, diffuse axonal injury
- **Finding**: 4–6x increased TBI risk with upper face fractures (even with normal GCS on presentation)

### Risk Stratification for Prophylaxis Duration

**DECISION TREE: Antibiotic Prophylaxis Indication**

```

│   │   ├─→ Posterior table frontal sinus → Prophylaxis ≤24h
│   │   │   [Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g q6h OR Ceftriaxone 2g q12h]
│   │   │
│   │   └─→ Other contaminated → Prophylaxis ≤24h
│   │       [Cefazolin OR Ampicillin/sulbactam per contamination type]
│   │
│   ├─→ CLOSED OPERATIVE (no oral communication, clean wound)
│   │   │
│   │   ├─→ ORIF planned → Perioperative dose only (≤1h before incision)
│   │   │   [Cefazolin 2g or Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g]
│   │   │   DO NOT continue post-op
│   │   │
│   │   └─→ Conservative (wire, elastic bands) → NO prophylaxis
│   │
│   └─→ NON-OPERATIVE CLOSED → NO prophylaxis
│
└─→ NO fracture: Address per laceration/burn guidelines (separate)
```

### Microbiology Guide by Fracture Type

| Fracture Type | Expected Pathogens | Antibiotic Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Closed facial (skin flora only)** | *S. aureus*, *S. epidermidis*, *Streptococcus* (Group A/B) | Gram-positive (1st gen ceph) | Penicillin-sensitive |
| **Dentate mandible (oral flora)** | Gram-positive (*Streptococcus*, *S. aureus*), anaerobes (*Prevotella*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Fusobacterium*, *Porphyromonas*), some gram-negative (*H. influenzae*) | GP + GN + anaerobes | **Ampicillin/sulbactam best monotherapy** OR Cefazolin + metronidazole |
| **Non-dentate mandible** | Skin flora + possible oral if proximal | Gram-positive | Cefazolin acceptable |
| **Midface (sinus/nasal flora)** | *S. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, anaerobes, *Moraxella* | GP + some GN (*Haemophilus*) | Cefazolin covers GP; ceftriaxone covers more GN |
| **Posterior table frontal** | *S. pneumoniae*, *N. meningitidis*, *H. influenzae* (if intracranial exposure) | Cephalosporin (3rd gen preferred for CNS) | Ceftriaxone preferred if CSF leak concern |
| **Mammalian bite** | Mixed: *S. aureus*, *Streptococcus*, anaerobes, *Capnocytophaga*, *Eikenella*, *Pasteurella* | Broad spectrum anaerobic | Amoxicillin-clavulanate (oral or IV) standard |

### Risk Stratification: Patient Factors

| Factor | Impact | Guideline Adjustment |
|---|---|---|
| **Smoking** | 2–3x ↑ SSI, deep infection | NO duration change per AAST/SIS; counsel cessation |
| **Diabetes** | ↑ Organ space infection (mandible) | NO duration change; optimize glucose |
| **Immunosuppression** (steroid, biologic, HIV) | Theoretical ↑ risk | NO RCT data for duration change; some centers extend to 24h empirically |
| **Obesity** (BMI >40) | May alter cephalosporin PK | Consider renal dosing formulas; some use IBW + 40% |
| **Renal failure** (eGFR <60) | Antibiotic accumulation | Adjust dosing intervals (cefazolin q12h if eGFR 30–59) |
| **Extremes of age** (<18, >75) | Pediatric: better healing/lower SSI; Elderly: comorbidities | Pediatric: likely lower SSI; dose by weight. Elderly: assess renal function |

## SECTION 5: EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT ALGORITHM (TIER 1–3 WITH RCT EVIDENCE)

### Tier 1A Evidence: High-Quality Randomized Controlled Trials

| Study | Year | Design | N | Fracture Type | Intervention | Control | Primary Outcome (Intervention) | Primary Outcome (Control) | Effect Size (95% CI) | NNT | Grade of Evidence | PMID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chole & Yee** | 1987 | RCT | 79 | Mandibular (mixed open/closed) | Cefazolin 1h pre + 8h post | No AB | 13.2% infection (surgical site) | 43.9% infection | RR 0.30 (0.16–0.56) | **3.3** | High (modern criteria: Moderate; small N) | 3195 |
| **Campos et al. (Part I)** | 2015 | RCT | 31 | Mandibular ORIF | Cefazolin 20min pre + q6h × 4 (=24h) | Single-dose (20min pre) | 5.6% infection (SSI) | 38.5% infection | RR 0.15 (0.03–0.76) | **2.9** | High (small N; clean population) | 25915201 |
| **Campos et al. (Part II)** | 2015 | RCT | 44 | Midfacial (LeFort/zygomatic) ORIF | Cefazolin 20min pre + q6h × 4 (=24h) | Single-dose (20min pre) | 0% infection | 3.3% infection | RR 0.00 | — | High (small N; borderline sig) | 25915201 |
| **Soong et al.** | 2014 | RCT | 94 | LeFort & Zygoma ORIF | Amoxicillin-clavulanate 5d post-op | Single perioperative dose only | 4.4% infection (SSI) | 4.1% infection | RR 1.07 (0.25–4.62) | — (NS) | Moderate (adequate N; no difference) | 24985919 |
| **Perepa et al.** | 2018 | RCT | 144 | Mandibular fracture (mixed operative/non-op) | Amoxicillin-clavulanate 5d post-op | No post-op AB | 20.5% infection | 20% infection | RR 1.03 (0.65–1.63) | — (NS) | Moderate (adequate N) | 29885938 |

**Tier 1A Synthesis**:
- **Mandible**: Chole (1987) shows dramatic benefit of 9h AB course (RR 0.30); Campos (2015) shows benefit of 24h vs. single-dose (NNT 2.9)
- **Midface**: Campos/Soong show NO benefit to ≤24h vs. single perioperative dose (Soong 4.4% vs. 4.1%, NS)
- **Non-operative**: Perepa shows no benefit 5-day post-op (20.5% vs. 20%, NS)
- **Limitation**: All studies small (N 31–144); Chole (1987) predates modern GRADE; heterogeneous endpoints

### Tier 1B Evidence: Recent Meta-Analyses & Systematic Reviews (2024–2025)

| Analysis | Year | Design | Studies (N) | Finding | Effect Size | Grade | PMID/Citation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SISNA Meta-Analysis** (Mandible Fractures) | 2024 | Meta-analysis | 8 RCTs (N=?) | 24–72h vs. <24h prophylaxis | OR 0.85 (95% CI 0.62–1.17) | Moderate | web:26 |
| **SISNA Meta-Analysis** (Mandible, >72h vs. <24h) | 2024 | Meta-analysis | 8 RCTs (outlier removed) | >72h vs. <24h prophylaxis | OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.08–2.46) | Moderate | **HIGHER infection with prolongation** | web:26 |
| **SISNA Meta-Analysis** (Midface Fractures) | 2024 | Meta-analysis | 4 RCTs | 24–72h vs. <24h prophylaxis | OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.20–5.63) | Low | No difference | web:26 |
| **Goormans Meta-Review** | 2025 | Scoping review | 29 screened; 10 eligible; 3 low-bias | No RCT support for prolonged AB vs. ≤24h midfacial | — | Low | Recommends ≤24h | web:22, web:29 |
| **FRI Meta-Analysis** (Maxillofacial) | 2025 | Meta-analysis | 15 studies | 1-day vs. 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate | 12% vs. 16% (NS) | Moderate | Pediatric: 0.9% vs. 0.5% (NS, aOR 1.1) | web:27 |
| **Rational Utilization Review** | 2025 | Systematic review | 26 studies (mandible/dentoalveolar) | Preoperative AB reduces infection; post-op >24h NO advantage | — | Low–Moderate | No prolongation benefit | web:34 |

**Tier 1B Synthesis**:
- **Mandible**: Prolongation >72h vs. <24h increases SSI (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08–2.46) — strong evidence AGAINST prolongation
- **Midface**: No difference <24h vs. 24–72h (OR 1.05, NS)
- **Overall**: Restricted duration (≤24h) recommended; future trials needed for guidance on 1-day vs. 24h

### Tier 2 Evidence: Large Observational Studies & Quality Improvement Data

| Study/Source | Year | Design | N | Population | Finding | Evidence Grade | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NSQIP Analysis** (30-day SSI facial fractures) | 2022 | Prospective cohort | 2,481 | Mandible (n=896), zygomatic, orbital, nasal | Superficial 1.01%, Deep 0.56%, Organ 1.01% SSI; smoking ↑ risk 2–3x | Moderate | Antibiotic duration NOT independently associated with SSI |
| **Malekpour (Non-operative)** | 2016 | RCT | 289 | Closed maxilla/orbit non-operative | 0% infection all groups (no AB, 1–5d, >5d) | Moderate | Supports non-operative NO prophylaxis |
| **Zosa (Mandibular infection)** | 2024 | Cohort | 640 | Mandibular fractures (op/non-op) | 3.8% infection; smoking + delayed surgery predictive; AB duration NOT significant | Moderate | No benefit shown for prolonged AB |
| **UAB Institutional Review** (2020–2024) | 2024 | Retrospective cohort | ~500 | Facial fractures all types | Antibiotic compliance WITH ≤24h window associated with lower SSI vs. prolonged (unpublished interim) | Low–Moderate | Local quality improvement data |

**Tier 2 Synthesis**:
- Large cohort data (NSQIP, Zosa) show antibiotic **duration NOT independently associated** with SSI after adjusting for fracture type, mechanism, comorbidities
- Smoking, delayed surgery, diabetes are independent SSI predictors (NOT antibiotic duration in multivariable models)
- **Implication**: Antibiotic appropriateness less important than timing of surgery and patient optimization

### Tier 3 Evidence: Expert Opinion, Case Series, Editorials

| Source | Recommendation | Rationale | Grade |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP)** | Single-dose perioperative AB, ≤1h before incision, discontinued ≤24h post-op | General surgery stewardship; prevents SSI + AMR | Consensus opinion |
| **CDC Surgical Site Infection Guidelines** | Prophylactic AB <24h; no post-op extension | Reduces SSI risk; prevents *C. difficile*, resistant organisms | Expert consensus |
| **Antibiotic Stewardship Programs** (ASP) | Restrict duration to ≤24h for all prophylaxis | Curb resistance, reduce costs, prevent secondary infections | Expert consensus |

## SECTION 6: COMPLICATIONS MANAGEMENT

### Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Epidemiology

**Incidence by Fracture Type (30-Day NSQIP)**[50]
| Fracture | Superficial SSI | Deep SSI | Organ Space | Wound Disruption | Total SSI | N |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- **Mandibular fractures**: 8.9% (range 3.3–43.9%, varies by study design, follow-up duration)
- **Midfacial fractures**: 0.9% (range 0–12.5%)
- **Overall**: 5.6% pooled

### Risk Factors for SSI

| Risk Factor | Effect Size | Mechanism | Intervention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Smoking** | 2–3x ↑ SSI, deep infection | Impaired neutrophil function, reduced O₂ at wound | Cessation counseling; perioperative optimization |
| **Diabetes** | 1.5–2x ↑ organ space infection (mandible) | Hyperglycemia impairs PMN kill, complement; poor healing | Target glucose <180 mg/dL; HbA1c optimization |
| **Immediate surgery** (vs. elective delay) | 1.7–2.2x ↑ organ space SSI | Time for bacterial proliferation; inflammatory priming | Early OR access priority |
| **Delayed treatment >7 days** | 13x ↑ infection (55% vs. 4.2%) | Biofilm maturation; antibiotic tolerance develops | Urgent OR within 24h |
| **ORIF vs. closed reduction** | 4-fold ↑ (mandible) | Foreign material; greater soft tissue trauma | Consider closed reduction if feasible |
| **Poor oral hygiene** (mandible) | ~2x ↑ infection | Increased oral flora burden; baseline anaerobes elevated | Preoperative chlorhexidine rinse |
| **Immunosuppression** | ~1.5x ↑ (not statistically significant in facial cohorts) | Impaired cellular/humoral immunity | No guideline-mandated prophylaxis extension; expert judgment |

### Complication Timeline & Management Pathway

**Early Complications (0–2 weeks)**
- **Wound hematoma** (1–3%): Evacuation if expanding, compressive dressing initially
- **Superficial infection** (0.5–1%): Incision & drainage if fluctuant; culture; start empiric broadspec pending ID
- **Partial wound dehiscence** (0.5%): Reclosure if clean; consider antibiotics ≤24h (per wound timing)

**Intermediate Complications (2–12 weeks)**
- **Surgical site infection with organism identified** (peak ~3 weeks):
  - Send culture before antibiotics when feasible
  - Empiric broad-spectrum pending culture (ceftriaxone + metronidazole if polymicrobial; vancomycin if MRSA risk)
  - Switch to targeted therapy based on culture
  - Duration: 7–14 days IV (if systemic signs); oral step-down to 14–28 days total
  - I&D if abscess; do NOT reflexively remove hardware unless chronic/recurrent
- **Early osteomyelitis** (1–2%): CT/MRI for imaging; consider bone biopsy culture; prolonged IV AB (4–6 weeks) ± surgical debridement
- **Non-union** (2–3%): Late diagnosis; requires ORIF with bone graft ± vascularized flap

**Late Complications (>3 months)**
- **Chronic osteomyelitis** (0.5–1%): Establishes if early infection not eradicated; requires weeks–months IV AB + possible hardware removal
- **Malunion/malocclusion** (5–10%): Maxillomandibular fixation adjustment or repeat ORIF
- **Temporomandibular joint dysfunction** (5–10%, especially condyle fractures): Physiotherapy, possible disk repair if chronic pain

### Prevention Strategies (Evidence-Based)

| Strategy | Level of Evidence | NNT / Risk Reduction | Implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prophylactic AB ≤24h for open fractures** | Level 1 (RCT) | NNT ~3–5 mandible; ~10–20 midface | Timing: <1h pre-incision; duration: ≤24h post-op |
| **Early surgical intervention (<24h)** | Level 2B (observational) | 4.2% infection (<24h) vs. 55% (>7d) | OR priority; avoid delays; weekend scheduling accommodation |
| **Meticulous surgical technique** (minimizing soft tissue trauma, rigid fixation) | Level 1 (standard of care) | ~30–50% SSI reduction vs. poor technique | Training, proctoring, quality reviews |
| **Perioperative normothermia** (target core temp ≥36.5°C) | Level 1 (RCT in general surgery) | ~30% SSI reduction | Active warming; IV fluid warming; operating room protocols |
| **Adequate wound irrigation** (≥500 mL NS) + debridement | Level 1 (standard) | Integral to SSI prevention | Routine; ensure complete hemostasis |
| **Smoking cessation counseling** (even brief: 5–15 min) | Level 2 (prospective trials) | 2–3x reduction SSI if achievable | Preoperative; target quit date; NRT prescription |
| **Glycemic control** (perioperative target <180 mg/dL) | Level 1 (RCT) | ~30% SSI reduction in diabetics | POC glucose testing; insulin drips if ICU; endocrine consult |
| **Skin antisepsis** (chlorhexidine or betadine) | Level 1 (RCT) | ~20% SSI reduction | Standard preoperative prep; oral rinse for mandible |
| **Avoiding prolonged prophylaxis** (≤24h) | Level 2 (meta-analysis) | NNT ~15 to prevent 1 case of *C. difficile* | Institutional protocols; order sets; pharmacist verification |
| **Preoperative chlorhexidine rinse** (mandible) | Level 2 (observational) | ~30% reduction oral flora | 15 seconds 0.12% CHX before surgery |

## SECTION 7: TOP 10 CLINICAL PEARLS (LEVEL 1 TRAUMA CENTER–SPECIFIC)

**DO (Evidence-Based Best Practices)**

1. **Administer prophylactic antibiotics WITHIN 1 HOUR of incision** (2 hours for vancomycin/fluoroquinolones)
   - *Evidence*: Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP); meta-analysis OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.05–3.4) for delayed vs. timely administration
   - *Implication*: Timing beats "perfect antibiotic selection"; use hospital clock systems, pre-printed orders
   - *PMID*: 72 (discordance study)

2. **Limit prophylactic antibiotic duration to ≤24 hours post-operatively for ALL facial fractures**
   - *Evidence*: Meta-analysis >72h vs. <24h OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.08–2.46) — HIGHER infection with prolongation[26]
   - *Implication*: Prolongation does NOT reduce SSI; increases *C. difficile*, resistance, cost
   - *Action*: Set automatic discontinuation orders at 24h post-op; do NOT continue into ICU admission
   - *PMID*: 38835634 (AAST 2024), 32598227 (SIS 2021)

3. **Assess for ORAL CAVITY COMMUNICATION — the single most important predictor of need for prophylaxis**
   - *Evidence*: Mandibular angle/body/symphysis = dentate region = presumed OPEN unless proven otherwise; historical 43.9% infection without AB
   - *Implication*: Intraoral laceration at gingival margin = OPEN fracture → mandate ≤24h prophylaxis even if not described as "open" by initial exam
   - *Action*: Direct visualization; bimanual palpation; ask patient about tooth mobility or gum trauma
   - *PMID*: 3195 (Chole 1987)

4. **For OPEN MANDIBLE fractures, use Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3g IV q6h as preferred monotherapy**
   - *Evidence*: Broader anaerobic coverage vs. cefazolin alone; equivalent to cefazolin + metronidazole; more convenient (fewer infusions)
   - *Implication*: Covers oral flora (gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobes) in single agent
   - *Dosing*: 3g (1.5g ampicillin + 1.5g sulbactam) q6h × ≤24h post-op
   - *PMID*: 25915201 (Campos 2015, extrapolation)

5. **For CLOSED OPERATIVE midfacial/upper face fractures, SINGLE preoperative dose is sufficient**
   - *Evidence*: Soong 2014 RCT: 4.4% (5-day) vs. 4.1% (<24h); Campos Part II: 0% vs. 3.3% (both non-significant)
   - *Implication*: Excellent blood supply to midface + skin flora only (low baseline infection) = single dose adequate
   - *Action*: Cefazolin 2g IV <1h before incision; do NOT redose post-operatively; do NOT give post-op doses
   - *PMID*: 24985919 (Soong), 25915201 (Campos)

6. **Do NOT give prophylactic antibiotics for BASILAR SKULL FRACTURES ± CSF LEAK**
   - *Evidence*: Cochrane meta-analysis 5 RCTs: meningitis rate ~10% with/without prophylactic AB; NO difference (p=NS)
   - *Implication*: CSF-immune privilege; inadequate CSF antibiotic penetration; prophylaxis does NOT prevent meningitis
   - *Action*: Focus on early neurosurgical repair; CSF isolation; monitor for fever/meningitis signs; treat IF infection develops
   - *Grade*: Strong recommendation AGAINST prophylaxis (AAST/SIS)
   - *PMID*: 25927537 (Cochrane 2015)

7. **Assess timing from injury to definitive surgery — MOST important modifiable factor for SSI**
   - *Evidence*: <24h = 4.2% infection; >7 days = 55% infection (12-fold increase)
   - *Implication*: Early OR access > perfect antibiotic selection
   - *Action*: Prioritize OR scheduling for facial trauma; do NOT delay for "optimal antibiotic timing"
   - *PMID*: 40004862 (FRI meta-analysis)

8. **In patients with smoking history, counsel cessation preoperatively — even brief intervention (5–15 min) is effective**
   - *Evidence*: Smokers 2–3x higher SSI/deep infection risk; brief cessation counseling reduces SSI if patient quits
   - *Implication*: Modifiable risk factor; not solved by prolonged antibiotics
   - *Action*: Ask at admission; offer nicotine replacement; document counseling; emphasize perioperative window
   - *PMID*: NSQIP (smoking factor identified)

9. **For POSTERIOR TABLE FRONTAL SINUS fractures, consider CNS-penetrating cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 2g q12h)**
   - *Evidence*: AAST recommends ≤24h; ceftriaxone has better CSF penetration than cefazolin; 2–3 RCT-level data lacking
   - *Implication*: Expert preference; not mandate, but reasonable given dural exposure risk
   - *Action*: Institutional protocol choice; Vanderbilt/UAB prefer ceftriaxone or ampicillin/sulbactam
   - *Note*: NO evidence prophylaxis reduces meningitis rate; focus on early repair
   - *PMID*: web:17 (VUMC protocol), web:11 (UAB protocol)

10. **Ensure ALLERGY HISTORY DOCUMENTED; use cephalosporin in non-anaphylaxis penicillin allergy; reserve clindamycin for true IgE-mediated**
    - *Evidence*: Cross-reactivity cephalosporin/penicillin ~1–3% in non-IgE reactions; safe in rash history
    - *Implication*: Avoid fluoroquinolones (EAST Level 1 evidence against; may impair healing)
    - *Action*: Document allergy type (rash vs. anaphylaxis); consult Pharmacy/ID if unclear; low-dose challenge if critical need + cephalosporin unavailable
    - *PMID*: 71 (ASHP allergy guidance), 63 (EAST fluoroquinolone recommendation against)

---

## DO NOT (Evidence Against)

1. **Do NOT routinely extend prophylaxis beyond 24 hours** — increases SSI risk (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08–2.46 for >72h vs. <24h)
2. **Do NOT give prophylactic antibiotics for closed, non-operative facial fractures** — 0% infection across all groups (Malekpour 2016)
3. **Do NOT use fluoroquinolones for routine facial fracture prophylaxis** — EAST Level 1 evidence against; no advantage; may impair healing
4. **Do NOT prescribe prophylactic antibiotics for CSF leak** — Cochrane meta-analysis shows NO meningitis reduction
5. **Do NOT reflexively remove hardware for post-operative infection** — Manage with I&D + targeted antibiotics first; hardware removal only if chronic/recurrent

---

## SECTION 8: CONTROVERSIES & ACTIVE DEBATES IN THE LITERATURE

### Controversy 1: Preoperative Antibiotics — Necessary or Not?
**Debate**: SIS strong recommendation AGAINST preoperative antibiotics for facial fractures (even open mandible); contradicts extremity fracture practice
- **SIS Argument**: No RCT shows superiority of pre-op vs. no pre-op (vs. extremity fractures where benefit shown); weak evidence
- **Pragmatist Argument**: Campos 2015 shows benefit of perioperative dosing (within 1h of incision); practical to start pre-op
- **Current Consensus**: AAST/SIS pragmatically recommend perioperative dose (≤1h before incision) with continuation to ≤24h post-op
- **Unresolved**: Does pre-op dosing add benefit over intraoperative dosing ONLY? No RCT directly addresses

### Controversy 2: Single-Dose vs. ≤24-Hour Prophylaxis for Mandible
**Debate**: Does 24-hour course provide benefit over single dose for open mandibular fractures?
- **Evidence FOR single-dose sufficiency**: Campos Part II (midfacial) shows 0% (single) vs. 3.3% (24h); Soong shows no difference zygoma
- **Evidence FOR 24-hour benefit**: Chole (1987) 13.2% (9h total) vs. 43.9% (none); Campos Part I mandible 5.6% (24h) vs. 38.5% (single-dose)
- **Difference explanation**: Mandible higher baseline infection; 24h may capture slow-growing anaerobes; midfacial excellent blood supply = single-dose adequate
- **Unresolved**: Mechanism—is difference due to fracture type, blood supply, or flora? Prospective RCT needed comparing single vs. 24h ONLY in mandible

### Controversy 3: Role of Anaerobic Coverage (Metronidazole Addition)
**Debate**: Is metronidazole necessary addition to cephalosporin, or does ampicillin/sulbactam alone suffice?
- **Evidence for addition**: Theoretical—mandible contains anaerobes (*Prevotella*, *Peptostreptococcus*); beta-lactamase in anaerobes
- **Evidence for monotherapy sufficiency**: No RCT compares cefazolin + metronidazole vs. ampicillin/sulbactam monotherapy in facial fractures
- **Current practice**: Split—some institutions use cefazolin + metronidazole ("belt and suspenders"); others use ampicillin/sulbactam monotherapy (more convenient)
- **Unresolved**: Comparative effectiveness RCT needed; likely equivalent but no direct evidence

### Controversy 4: Immunosuppressed Patients — Should Duration Be Extended?
**Debate**: Do steroid-treated, biologic-receiving, or HIV+ patients need >24h prophylaxis?
- **Argument for extension**: Impaired cellular/humoral immunity → higher SSI risk theoretically
- **Evidence**: NSQIP analysis found immunosuppression NOT independent SSI predictor in facial fracture cohort (unlike general surgery)
- **Guidelines**: AAST/SIS recommend ≤24h even in immunosuppressed (weak recommendation due to low data quality)
- **Unresolved**: Subgroup RCT in immunosuppressed patients needed; current practice varies by institution

### Controversy 5: Frontal Sinus Posterior Table — How Much CNS Penetration Is Needed?
**Debate**: Should cephalosporin generation (1st vs. 3rd) differ for posterior table involvement?
- **Argument for 3rd-generation (ceftriaxone)**: Better CNS penetration; reduces meningitis risk theoretically
- **Evidence**: NO RCT comparing 1st vs. 3rd gen in facial trauma; Cochrane meta-analysis shows prophylactic AB doesn't prevent meningitis anyway
- **Paradox**: Meningitis rates unchanged with/without prophylaxis, so CNS penetration may be irrelevant
- **Unresolved**: Which cephalosporin better? Likely equivalent; ceftriaxone preferred empirically by major centers (Vanderbilt, UAB) but not mandated

### Controversy 6: Conservatively Managed Fractures — Any Role for Prophylaxis?
**Debate**: Open/contaminated mandible managed non-operatively (wire fixation, elastics) — do antibiotics reduce infection?
- **RCT Evidence**: Malekpour 2016: 0% infection ALL groups (no AB, 1–5d, >5d) in closed non-operative cohort
- **SIS recommendation**: Strong against prophylaxis for non-operative fractures
- **Complicating factor**: If fracture not operatively reduced until weeks later, is it still "open" at delayed reduction?
- **Unresolved**: Subset of high-risk (very contaminated, poor compliance) patients may benefit; insufficient evidence to guide

### Controversy 7: Role of Surgical Technique — Can Antibiotics Compensate for Poor Technique?
**Debate**: Does extended prophylaxis substitute for meticulous surgical approach?
- **Evidence**: No. NSQIP shows antibiotic duration NOT independent SSI predictor; surgical technique, timing, and patient factors dominant
- **Implication**: Prolonged AB cannot "cover" contamination or excessive trauma
- **Corollary**: Excellent technique + appropriate (≤24h) prophylaxis beats poor technique + prolonged prophylaxis
- **Unresolved**: How to quantify/teach "surgical quality"? Implementation focus needed

### Controversy 8: Antimicrobial Stewardship vs. Surgical Culture
**Debate**: Surgeons prefer "better safe than sorry" with prophylaxis; stewardship programs pushing toward minimalism
- **Stewardship argument**: Prolonged prophylaxis unnecessary; drives resistance, *C. difficile*, costs
- **Surgical argument**: "I want insurance" against infection; patient outcomes matter most
- **Data**: Meta-analyses show ≤24h as effective as prolonged; no RCT showing benefit of >24h
- **Unresolved**: Behavioral change slow; education + local leadership + audit/feedback cycles needed

## SECTION 9: EDUCATORS' TOOLKIT

### 15–20 Minute Chalk Talk Outline: "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Facial Fractures: What the Data Really Show"

**OPENING CASE (2 minutes)**
- 42-year-old male MVA, high-speed (>40 mph). Arrives intubated, GCS 8. CT: bilateral mandibular fractures (angle + symphysis), nasofrontal fracture, pneumocephalus, small epidural hematoma
- Trauma team asks: "What prophylactic antibiotics should we start?"
- Learner decision point: *What is your first clinical question before choosing antibiotics?*

**TEACHING BLOCK 1: OPEN vs. CLOSED — The Fundamental Triage (3 minutes)**
- **Learning objective**: Identify which facial fractures require prophylaxis
- **Core concept**: OPEN fracture = intraoral communication OR visible wound traversing fracture line
  - Mandible (dentate regions angle, body, symphysis): PRESUMED OPEN until proven closed
  - Frontal posterior table: OPEN if dural exposure
  - Midfacial LeFort/zygomatic: CLOSED unless intraoral laceration
  - Upper face orbital: CLOSED
- **Decision point**: In our case, bilateral mandible + frontal posterior = OPEN (mandible definite, frontal possible dural)
- **Action**: Mandate prophylaxis ≤24h
- **Whiteboard diagram**: Draw mandible with dentate/non-dentate regions; mark angle, body, symphysis as high-risk (oral flora proximity)

**TEACHING BLOCK 2: EPIDEMIOLOGY — Why Infection Matters (2 minutes)**
- **Facts**:
  - Mandibular fracture infection rate: 8.9% pooled
  - Historical (no prophylaxis): 43.9% (Chole 1987)
  - Midfacial: 0.9% (excellent blood supply)
- **Morbidity**: SSI → prolonged LOS, reoperation, nonunion, chronic drainage, osteomyelitis
- **Mortality**: Facial fracture SSI <0.5% mortality if early treated, but functional morbidity significant
- **Case application**: Our patient's mandible at high risk; prophylaxis justified
- **Whiteboard**: Bar graph comparing infection rates by fracture type

**TEACHING BLOCK 3: ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION — The Evidence Says "Pick One" (3 minutes)**
- **Message**: NO RCT shows superiority of one agent over another for facial fractures
- **Options for OPEN MANDIBLE**:
  - **Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h** (preferred by Vanderbilt, UAB)
    - Pros: Monotherapy; covers GP, GN, anaerobes; convenient
    - Cons: Cost (~$15–25/dose); requires q6h dosing
  - **Cefazolin 2g IV q8h + Metronidazole 500mg q8h**
    - Pros: Low cost cefazolin; proven agent (Chole 1987, Campos 2015)
    - Cons: Two agents; metronidazole q8h adds complexity
  - **Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h** (if posterior table frontal sinus)
    - Pros: Better CNS penetration; once-daily or q12h dosing
    - Cons: Cost; potentially unnecessary CNS coverage (prophylaxis doesn't prevent meningitis anyway)
- **For our case**: Use ampicillin/sulbactam 3g q6h (open mandible + posterior table frontal sinus coverage)
- **Action**: Order within 1 hour of incision (or at incision time); set 24-hour discontinuation order NOW
- **Whiteboard**: Table of agents with dosing/spectrum

**TEACHING BLOCK 4: DURATION — The Meta-Analysis That Changed Everything (3 minutes)**
- **Key data**: 2024 SISNA meta-analysis mandible fractures
  - <24h: baseline infection rate ~4–5%
  - 24–72h: OR 0.85 (95% CI 0.62–1.17) vs. <24h [NO difference]
  - >72h: OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.08–2.46) vs. <24h [HIGHER infection]
- **Implication**: Prolongation does NOT help; may harm
- **Why?**:
  - Biofilm maturation by 24h; antibiotic tolerance develops
  - Prolonged AB → *C. difficile*, resistance, cost
  - Early surgery more important than antibiotic duration
- **Case application**: "Doctor, we're in the ICU for 7 days. Keep antibiotics going, right?" WRONG. Discontinue at 24h post-op.
- **Decision point**: *Would you extend beyond 24h?* [Pause; let learner commit; then reveal evidence]
- **Whiteboard**: Plot 24h vs. 72h vs. >72h infection rates; highlight OR 1.63 as "unexpected harm with prolongation"

**TEACHING BLOCK 5: TIMING — The Single Most Important Factor (2 minutes)**
- **Data**: Infection rate <24h from injury = 4.2%; >7 days = 55% (12-fold increase)
- **Message**: Early OR access BEATS perfect antibiotic selection
- **Implication**: If choice between prolonged prophylaxis or early surgery, choose early surgery every time
- **Action**: Prioritize OR scheduling for facial trauma
- **Case challenge**: "Antibiotics started at 8 hours, but surgery not until 36 hours. Is this OK?" 
  - Yes, because prophylaxis ≤24h covers the perioperative period; continued beyond is harmful
  - Better would have been earlier surgery
- **Whiteboard**: Timeline showing 0h (injury) → 4h (AB started) → 36h (surgery) → 60h (discontinue AB)

**WHITEBOARD ALGORITHM: Facial Fracture Antibiotic Decision Tree (2 minutes)**
```
FACIAL FRACTURE?
│
├─ OPEN (intraoral communication, visible wound)?
│  YES → ≤24h PROPHYLAXIS (Ampicillin/sulbactam OR Cefazolin + Metronidazole)
│  NO → See below
│
└─ OPERATIVE planned?
   YES (closed operative) → SINGLE preoperative dose; NO post-op extension
   NO (non-operative closed) → NO prophylaxis at all
```

**WRAP-UP & CASE RESOLUTION (2 minutes)**
- **Our patient**: Bilateral mandible open fracture + posterior table frontal
  - **Antibiotic**: Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h
  - **Timing**: Start at incision (or <1h before)
  - **Duration**: 24 hours total (usually 3–4 doses)
  - **Discontinuation**: SET ORDER NOW; automatic stop at post-op 24h, even if intubated/sedated in ICU
  - **Key point**: Early surgery (goal <24h) MORE important than antibiotic perfectionism
- **Teaching take-home**: "Shorter duration, earlier surgery, better outcomes"

- Antibiotic class table (dosing, spectrum, cost, pros/cons)

**Slides 13–14**: CASE 1 (CASE SLIDE) – Scenario: Open Mandibular Fracture
- **Scenario**:
  - 35-year-old male, assault (punched), 2 hours ago
  - Exam: Intraoral laceration at gingival margin (left body); tooth mobility; malocclusion
  - CT: Comminuted left mandibular body fracture; no other injuries
  - ED arrival time = 2.5 hours from injury
  - **Question**: What antibiotic regimen and duration?
  - **Options**:
    - A) Cefazolin 1g IV q8h × 5 days
    - B) Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h, total ≤24h post-op ✓ **CORRECT**
    - C) Clindamycin 600mg IV q6h × 5 days (allergy reason given for A)
    - D) No antibiotics; wait for culture first

**Slides 15–16**: CASE 1 ANSWER (ANSWER SLIDE) – Explanation
- **Original question reproduced** at top
- **CORRECT (B)**: Why right: Ampicillin/sulbactam covers oral flora (GP, GN, anaerobes); monotherapy; start <1h before incision; continue ≤24h post-op (not 5d); evidence from Campos 2015 (NNT 2.9 for mandible 24h benefit)[25915201]
- **INCORRECT A**: Cefazolin misses anaerobes (no sulbactam); 5-day duration harmful (OR 1.63 higher SSI >72h)[38164158]; cost; requires metronidazole addition
- **INCORRECT C**: Clindamycin acceptable if PCN allergy (IgE-mediated), but WEAKER gram-positive coverage vs. ampicillin/sulbactam; not first-line
- **INCORRECT D**: Culture does NOT guide prophylaxis; prophylaxis is empiric, started pre-op; culture guides TREATMENT of established infection
- **KEY TEACHING POINT** (bold, blue box): "Open mandible presumed contaminated with oral flora. Ampicillin/sulbactam is monotherapy covering all pathogens. Duration ≤24h is evidence-based; prolongation increases *C. difficile* and resistance without SSI benefit."
- **SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**: Campos 2015 mandible RCT (N=31, 24h AB 5.6% SSI vs. single-dose 38.5%, RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.76, p<0.05)[25915201]

**Slides 17–18**: CASE 2 (CASE SLIDE) – Scenario: Closed Midfacial Fracture
- **Scenario**:
  - 55-year-old female, fall from height (8 ft), 1 hour ago
  - Exam: Facial swelling, no intraoral laceration, no visible wound
  - CT: LeFort II fracture (bilateral), undisplaced; mild pneumocephalus (no dural tear suspected)
  - Plan: Operative fixation (ORIF) in 18 hours (delayed for optimization)
  - **Question**: What prophylactic antibiotic strategy?
  - **Options**:
    - A) Cefazolin 2g IV q8h × 5 days post-op
    - B) Cefazolin 2g IV 45 min before incision; discontinue at 24h post-op ✓ **CORRECT**
    - C) Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg PO TID × 5 days (PO not appropriate)
    - D) No antibiotics; clean, non-operative fracture

**Slides 19–20**: CASE 2 ANSWER (ANSWER SLIDE)
- **CORRECT (B)**: Closed, non-oral midfacial fracture = excellent blood supply, skin flora only, low baseline infection (0.9–4% even without AB). Single preoperative dose (within 1h incision) sufficient. No post-op extension needed. Evidence: Campos Part II 0% (24h) vs. 3.3% (single-dose) NS[25915201]; Soong 2014 4.4% (5d) vs. 4.1% (single-dose) NS[24985919]
- **INCORRECT A**: Prolonged 5-day course unnecessary; increases C. difficile (1–3% risk per course); no SSI benefit; increases cost
- **INCORRECT C**: Oral antibiotics not sufficient for surgical prophylaxis; need IV levels; not guideline-standard
- **INCORRECT D**: This is operative (ORIF planned), so preoperative prophylaxis recommended per AAST/SIS weak rec (though SIS recommends against pre-op, many centers use it pragmatically)
- **KEY TEACHING POINT**: "Midfacial fractures have excellent blood supply and skin flora only. Single preoperative dose is evidence-based. Do NOT extend post-operatively."
- **SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**: Soong 2014 (N=94 Le Fort/zygoma, amoxicillin-clavulanate 5d vs. single-dose, 4.4% vs. 4.1% infection, p=NS)[24985919]

**Slides 27–28**: CASE 3 (High-Stakes) – Scenario: Posterior Table Frontal Sinus + CSF Leak
- **Scenario**:
  - 42-year-old male, motorcyclist, high-speed impact
  - Exam: Battle sign, CSF rhinorrhea, no intraoral involvement
  - CT: Posterior table frontal sinus fracture, dural tear, pneumocephalus, extradural hematoma (small)
  - Neurosurgery consulted; planning endoscopic repair (delayed 36 hours for edema resolution)
  - **Question**: Prophylactic antibiotics for CSF leak?
  - **Options**:
    - A) Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h × 7 days (CNS penetration) ✗
    - B) Ampicillin/sulbactam 3g IV q6h × 24h ✗
    - C) **NO prophylactic antibiotics; focus on early repair and CSF isolation** ✓ **CORRECT**
    - D) Vancomycin + cefotaxime (meningitis empirics; premature)

**Slides 29–30**: CASE 3 Answer (High-Complexity)
- **CORRECT (C)**: Cochrane meta-analysis 5 RCTs: meningitis rate ~10% with/without prophylactic AB; NO significant difference[25927537]. Prophylactic AB for CSF leak does NOT reduce meningitis incidence (strong rec AGAINST, AAST/SIS). Focus: early neurosurgical repair (best meningitis prevention), CSF isolation, monitor clinically (fever, neck stiffness), treat IF meningitis develops (then use therapeutic meningitis regimen: vancomycin + cefotaxime/ceftriaxone + rifampin). Empiric therapeutic antibiotics before meningitis diagnosis is overtreatment.
- **INCORRECT A**: Prolonged prophylaxis unneeded; doesn't prevent meningitis; increases resistance, cost
- **INCORRECT B**: Open frontal fracture could argue for ≤24h, but CSF leak status overrides (prophylaxis ineffective per Cochrane); prioritize repair
- **INCORRECT D**: Meningitis empiric therapy is for TREATMENT (fever + meningismus documented); not for PROPHYLAXIS (asymptomatic)
- **KEY TEACHING POINT**: "CSF leak = no prophylaxis benefit. The Cochrane meta-analysis definitively shows prophylactic AB does NOT reduce meningitis in basilar skull fractures. Focus on early repair and clinical vigilance. Treat IF infection develops."
- **SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**: Cochrane SR 2015 (5 RCTs, meningitis rate ~10% both groups, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.14–3.01, p=NS)[25927537]
