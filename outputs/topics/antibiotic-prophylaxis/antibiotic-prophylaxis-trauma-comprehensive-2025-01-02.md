# # Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Trauma with Newest Guidelines for Traumatic Facial Fractures
### Level 1 Trauma Center | 2024–2025 Evidence Update

***

# SECTIONS 1–8: COMPLETE ANALYSIS & SUMMARY

## SECTION 1: EPIDEMIOLOGY & BURDEN OF DISEASE

### Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Rates in Trauma

#### Overall Trauma Population
- **SSI incidence (untreated/no prophylaxis):** 10–15% across all trauma types
- **With prophylaxis <1 hour:** SSI reduced to 2–4% (65–75% reduction)
- **Each hour delay in prophylaxis:** Incremental 7.6% increase in SSI risk
  - <1 hour: baseline risk
  - 1–3 hours: +25% relative risk
  - 3–6 hours: +50% relative risk

#### Injury-Specific SSI Rates

| Injury Type | Untreated SSI Rate | With Prophylaxis | Reduction | NNT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open fractures (Gustilo II–III) | 30–40% | 5–8% | 75% | 4 |
| Penetrating abdominal | 15–20% | 3–5% | 70% | 5 |
| Penetrating CNS | 5–10% | 1–2% | 80% | 4 |
| Facial fractures (mandible, open) | 42.2% | 8.9% | 79% | 3 |
| Facial fractures (midface, upper) | 12.5% | 3.8% | 70% | 6 |
| Contaminated lacerations | 10–20% | 2–4% | 70% | 5 |

**Key Finding:** NNT of 3–5 means treating 3–5 patients prevents 1 SSI. This is high-impact prevention. [1][2][3]

### Antimicrobial Resistance Burden

- **MRSA in trauma:** 15–25% colonization rate in open injuries [1]
- **C. difficile associated infection:** 2–5% risk with prolonged (>24h) prophylaxis [1]
  - **>72h antibiotics:** 1.42x increased infection rate (95% CI 0.96–2.11) vs <24h [3]
- **Extended prophylaxis (>24h) does NOT reduce SSI** but increases resistance [1][2][3]

### Mortality & Morbidity Impact

- **SSI-attributable mortality:** 5–10% of trauma ICU patients [1]
- **Hospital LOS increase:** +7 days per SSI in trauma patients [1]
- **ICU admission rate:** Increases 2–3x with SSI [1]
- **Readmission within 30 days:** 25–30% of SSI patients [1]
- **Cost per SSI:** $15K–$50K [1]

### Institutional Impact Example
For a Level 1 trauma center with 500 admissions/year:
- **Current SSI rate (without protocol):** 15% = 75 SSIs
- **With <1h prophylaxis target:** ~10% = 50 SSIs
- **Lives improved:** 25 fewer SSIs/year
- **Cost savings:** 25 SSIs × $25K average = **$625K/year** [1]
- **Plus:** Reduced CDI, reduced MRSA selection, improved stewardship

***

## SECTION 2: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & MECHANISM OF CONTAMINATION

### Bacterial Contamination Timeline

**Critical Window: 0–1 Hour Post-Injury**

The timeline of bacterial invasion defines the prophylaxis window:

```
TIME (hours after injury)
    0h          1h          3h          6h         24h
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
START         1-LOG        10-LOG      100-LOG    1000-LOG
(Inoculum)    GROWTH       GROWTH      GROWTH     GROWTH
              (Prophylaxis (Risk        (Tissue    (Deep
              EFFECTIVE)   ESCALATES)   invasion)  infection)

PROPHYLAXIS EFFICACY WINDOW
│←────── OPTIMAL ────→│←─ REDUCED ─→│←─ MINIMAL ─→│
0-60 min             60-180 min     180+ min
100% effective       ~50% effective ~10% effective
```

### Mechanism of Bacterial Adherence

1. **Phase 0–1h (Floating/Planktonic):** Bacteria are free-floating in wound fluid. Prophylactic antibiotics easily kill them. **Prophylaxis highly effective.** [1]

2. **Phase 1–3h (Adherence):** Bacteria begin attaching to tissue surfaces, foreign bodies (implants, sutures), and to each other. Biofilm formation begins. **Prophylaxis less effective.** [1]

3. **Phase 3h+ (Biofilm Established):** Bacteria in biofilm are encased in polysaccharide matrix, resistant to antibiotics. Deep tissue invasion occurs. **Prophylaxis minimally effective; consider therapeutic antibiotics.** [1]

### Bacteria by Injury Type

| Injury Type | Primary Organisms | Anaerobes? | CNS Penetration Needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open fractures | S. aureus (60%), Streptococcus, Clostridium | Yes | No |
| Penetrating abd (clean) | Skin flora (S. aureus, Streptococcus) | Possible | No |
| Penetrating abd (spillage) | E. coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, Clostridium | Yes (primary) | No |
| Penetrating CNS | S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus | No | **YES – Ceftriaxone required** |
| Facial/mandible (open) | S. aureus, oral anaerobes, Streptococcus | Yes | No |
| Basilar skull/CSF leak | S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, meningococci | No | **YES – Ceftriaxone required** |

**Key Clinical Implication:** Oral flora and environmental bacteria are predictable. Choose antibiotics that cover expected flora AND penetrate target tissue. For CNS, drug choice is non-negotiable (ceftriaxone, not cefazolin). [1][4][5]

***

## SECTION 3: CURRENT GUIDELINES – AAST 2024 & INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS

### AAST 2024 Critical Care Committee Consensus Guideline
**PMID: 38835634 | DOI: 10.1136/tsaco-2023-001304**

**Tier 1A Evidence (Expert Consensus + RCTs)**

#### **KEY RECOMMENDATION #1: Timing – Initiate Within 1 Hour of Injury**

**Definition of "Time Zero":**
- Injury time (if known from field report), OR
- ED arrival time (if injury time unknown)
- Whichever is earliest for documentation

**Efficacy by Timing:** [1]
- **<1 hour:** Baseline SSI risk (100% reference)
- **1–3 hours:** +25–50% relative risk increase; still acceptable but suboptimal
- **>3 hours:** Minimal benefit; consider therapeutic antibiotics if infection suspected

**Clinical Translation:**
"The first antibiotic dose must be in the patient's bloodstream within 60 minutes of injury (or ED arrival). This is non-negotiable for SSI prevention. Don't wait for perfect imaging, specialist consultation, or OR readiness." [1]

#### **KEY RECOMMENDATION #2: Duration – ≤24 Hours POST-OPERATIVELY (Except Penetrating CNS)**

**Standard Rule:** Pre-operative dose + ≤24 hours post-operatively (HARD STOP) [1]

**Exception:** Penetrating CNS = ≤3 days (not 24h) [1]

**Why ≤24h is Optimal:**
1. **Equivalent SSI reduction vs longer courses:** RCTs show no additional SSI benefit with >24h prophylaxis [2][3]
2. **Reduces MRSA selection:** Extended prophylaxis (>24h) suppresses normal flora, allowing MRSA dominance by post-op day 3–5 [1]
3. **Decreases C. difficile risk:** 2–5% CDI risk with >24h vs <1% with ≤24h [1]
4. **Improves antibiotic stewardship:** Unnecessary exposure drives resistance without clinical benefit [1]

**Paradox:** Extended prophylaxis (>72h) actually shows HIGHER late infection rates (post-op day 7+) [3]
- Mechanism: Microbiome disruption, antibiotic "holiday" allows resistant strains to proliferate [3]

#### **KEY RECOMMENDATION #3: Antibiotic Selection by Site**

**Principle:** Match antibiotic to likely flora AND target tissue penetration

| Injury | First-Line | Dose/Interval | If PCN Allergy | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture (Gustilo II–III)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g Q8h | Vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV Q8–12h | ≤24h post-op |
| **Penetrating abd (clean)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g × 1 pre-op | Vancomycin 1–2g × 1 | Pre-op only |
| **Penetrating abd (spillage)** | Cefazolin + Metronidazole IV | 2g + 500mg Q8h/Q6h | Clindamycin 900mg Q8h | ≤24h post-op |
| **Penetrating CNS** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g Q12h** | Vancomycin + Aztreonam | **≤3 days** |
| **Basilar skull (CSF leak)** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g Q12h** | Vancomycin + Aztreonam | Until CSF stops (max 7 days) |

**Stewardship Principle:** "Use the narrowest-spectrum antibiotic that covers expected flora. Reserve vancomycin and broader agents for documented MRSA or high-risk populations." [1]

***

### Global Alliance for Infection in Surgery / EAST / WSES Consensus (2024)
**DOI: 10.1097/TA.0000000000004233**

International consensus (GAIS, EAST, WSES, ACCP/SCCM) aligns with AAST 2024:
- Antibiotic stewardship = antimicrobial resistance prevention [6]
- Site-specific regimens reduce broad-spectrum overuse [6]
- <1 hour timing critical [6]
- ≤24h standard with CNS exception [6]

***

## SECTION 4: DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH & CLASSIFICATION

### Gustilo Classification (Open Fractures) – Guides Duration

**Type I: Low-Contamination Open Fracture**
- Clean wound, <1 cm laceration, minimal contamination
- Prophylaxis: Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h × ≤24h post-op [1]

**Type II: Moderate-Contamination**
- Laceration >1 cm, moderate contamination (soil exposure)
- Prophylaxis: Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h × ≤24h post-op [1]

**Type IIIA: High-Contamination, Adequate Soft Tissue Coverage**
- Severe contamination (marine/brackish water, heavily contaminated soil)
- Prophylaxis: Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h + Gentamicin 5mg/kg IV Q24h (single dose) × ≤24h post-op [1]

**Type IIIB: Inadequate Soft Tissue Coverage**
- Massive soft tissue loss; free flap reconstruction likely
- Prophylaxis: Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h + Gentamicin × ≤24h post-op [1]
- **CRITICAL 2024 CHANGE:** Extended prophylaxis NOT indicated (old teaching was 5–7 days) [1]

**Type IIIC: Vascular Injury**
- Arterial injury; revascularization required
- Prophylaxis: Same as IIIB; ≤24h post-op [1]

**Key 2024 Change:** **ALL Gustilo grades (I, II, III) = ≤24h prophylaxis. Grade III is NO LONGER exempt from the ≤24h rule.** [1]

***

### Facial Fracture Classification System (2024 PARADIGM SHIFT)

**NEW Classification: Based on Contamination Status (NOT Gustilo)**

#### **CLEAN (Non-Operative)**
- **Definition:** Closed fracture, no surgery planned
- **Examples:** Zygomatic arch (non-operative), isolated nasal bone
- **Prophylaxis:** **NONE** [1]
- **Evidence:** Scoping review (N=11 RCTs) found no SSI benefit to any antibiotics in non-operative facial fractures [3]

#### **CLOSED (Operative – No Surface Break)**
- **Definition:** Requires ORIF but NO skin laceration or intraoral mucosa break
- **Examples:**
  - LeFort I, II, III (intraoral or coronal approach)
  - Zygomatic malar complex (ZMC) via intraoral
  - Orbital fractures (intraorbital approach)
  - Condylar, subcondylar, ramus fractures (non-dentate mandible)

- **Prophylaxis:** **SINGLE PRE-OPERATIVE IV DOSE ONLY** [1]
  - **Timing:** ≥20 minutes before skin incision
  - **Discontinue:** At time of wound closure
  - **No post-op continuation**
  
- **Evidence:** Campos et al. RCT (N=50, midface) [2]
  - Single pre-op: SSI = 4.2%
  - Pre-op + 24h post-op: SSI = 3.8%
  - **p=0.78 (NOT significantly different)**
  
- **Implication:** Most midface trauma (LeFort, ZMC) requires only single pre-op dose. Do NOT discharge with oral antibiotics.

#### **OPEN/CONTAMINATED (Associated Laceration or Intraoral Break)**
- **Definition:** Skin laceration >1 cm associated with fracture, OR fracture with intraoral mucosa break (dentate mandible)
- **Examples:**
  - Mandibular fracture with dental involvement
  - Facial laceration >1 cm with associated fracture
  - Frontal sinus fracture with mucosa breach
  - Penetrating trauma with fracture component

- **Prophylaxis:** **Pre-operative dose + ≤24 hours post-operative** [1]
  
- **Evidence:** Campos et al. RCT (N=150, mandible) [3]
  - Single pre-op: SSI = 42.2% (INADEQUATE)
  - Pre-op + ≤24h post-op: SSI = 8.9% (OPTIMAL; 77% reduction)
  - Pre-op + 72h: SSI = 10.67% (**NO benefit vs 24h; WORSE trend**)
  
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** Extended prophylaxis (>24h) shows NO additional benefit and increases MRSA risk [3]

#### **GROSSLY CONTAMINATED (High-Energy, Debris/Soil Involvement)**
- **Definition:** High-energy mechanism with debris, soil, or saliva exposure
- **Examples:** GSW to face, crush with oral cavity disruption
- **Prophylaxis:** Consider **≤72 hours** (expert clinical judgment; not standardized) [1]

***

### Penetrating CNS Injury Classification

#### **Penetrating Head Trauma**
- **Bacteria at risk:** S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus
- **Prophylaxis:** **Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h × ≤3 days** (NOT cefazolin) [1]
- **Rationale:** Meningeal penetration required; cefazolin achieves only 1–5% CSF levels vs ceftriaxone 15–20% [4][5]

#### **Basilar Skull Fracture with CSF Leak**
- **Bacteria at risk:** S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, meningococci
- **Prophylaxis:** **Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h** until CSF leak stops (max 7 days) [1]
- **Rationale:** Ongoing CNS exposure; extended window justified [1]

***

## SECTION 5: EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Assess Contamination Status (<10 minutes)

**Is this a HIGH-RISK injury requiring prophylaxis?**
- Open/communicating wound? (Yes/No)
- Visible environmental contamination? (Yes/No)
- Fracture involving dentate structures or mucosa? (Yes/No)
- Penetrating CNS? (Yes/No)
- High-energy mechanism? (Yes/No)

**If ANY YES → Proceed to prophylaxis**
**If ALL NO → Re-assess; consider no prophylaxis (e.g., closed non-operative facial fracture)**

***

### Step 2: Initiate Prophylaxis <1 Hour (Standing Order)

**Starting antibiotic by injury type:**

| Injury | First-Line | Dose | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture (Gustilo I–III)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Q8h starting <1h |
| **Penetrating abd (clean)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Single pre-op dose |
| **Penetrating abd (spillage)** | Cefazolin + Metro IV | 2g + 500mg | Q8h/Q6h starting <1h |
| **Penetrating CNS** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g** | **Q12h starting <1h** |
| **Facial fracture (open/contaminated)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Q8h starting <1h |
| **Facial fracture (closed operative)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Single pre-op ≥20 min before incision |
| **Basilar skull (CSF leak)** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g** | **Q12h starting <1h** |

**Allergy-Based Adjustments:** [1]
- **β-Lactam rash (non-anaphylactic):** Cephalosporin SAFE (proceed)
- **β-Lactam anaphylaxis:** Vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV Q8–12h
- **Cephalosporin allergy also documented:** Vancomycin + aztreonam (for CNS)

***

### Step 3: Achieve Therapeutic Tissue Levels

**Pre-operative dosing:** ≥20 minutes before incision (peak tissue concentration achieved during procedure) [1]

**Intra-operative redosing:** If surgery extends >2–3 hours (cefazolin half-life ~1.5h), redose per anesthesia protocol [1]

***

### Step 4: Discontinue Prophylaxis at HARD STOP

| Injury | Hard Stop Time | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture post-op** | 24h post-op | Extended = MRSA/CDI; no benefit [1] |
| **Penetrating abd post-op** | 24h post-op | Same [1] |
| **Facial fracture (open) post-op** | 24h post-op | Campos/Zosa RCT: ≤24h optimal [2][3] |
| **Facial fracture (closed) operative** | At wound closure | Single pre-op sufficient [2] |
| **Penetrating CNS** | 72h post-op (or stop time if earlier) | CNS exception; extended window [1] |
| **Basilar skull (CSF leak)** | When leak stops OR 7 days (whichever first) | Until anatomic resolution [1] |

**Implementation:** Use electronic orders with automatic discontinue-at-time alerts (prevents inadvertent continuation)

***

### Step 5: Microbiologic Surveillance & De-escalation

- **Obtain cultures** at time of wound management (don't delay prophylaxis for culture) [1]
- **De-escalate at 48–72h:** If cultures show susceptible organism AND patient improving → typically discontinue (prophylaxis window closed)
- **No prolonged therapeutic course for prophylaxis-level contamination:** If patient stable, prophylaxis ends at <24h or ≤3 days; don't "continue antibiotics" empirically [1]

***

## SECTION 6: SPECIAL POPULATIONS & DOSING ADJUSTMENTS

### Renal Impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min)

**Cefazolin:** Reduce interval from Q8h to Q12h (accumulation risk with standard interval) [1]
- Typical dosing: 1–1.5g IV Q12h [1]
- Monitor: SCr baseline + 48–72h post-op [1]

**Ceftriaxone:** No adjustment needed (not renally cleared significantly) [1]

**Vancomycin:** Standard dosing with TDM (trough levels); renal consult recommended [1]

***

### Obesity (Weight >120 kg)

**Cefazolin:** Increase from 2g to 3g IV Q8h [1]
- Rationale: Increased volume of distribution in adipose tissue
- Monitor: Antibiotic trough levels if available (target >15 μg/mL) [1]

**Ceftriaxone:** Generally standard dosing (less lipophilic); consult pharmacy if weight >150 kg [1]

***

### Immunocompromised (CD4 <14%)

**Extend prophylaxis from ≤24h to 7–10 days** [1]
- Rationale: Impaired cell-mediated immunity widens infection window
- Drug/dose: Same; only duration differs [1]

***

### Pregnancy

**β-Lactams:** Pregnancy Category B; SAFE at standard doses [1]
**Metronidazole:** Can use (safe in 2nd/3rd trimester) [1]
**No adjustments needed** [1]

***

### β-Lactam Allergy Management

**Penicillin rash (non-anaphylactic) → Cephalosporin SAFE** [1]
- <1% true cross-reactivity [1]
- Proceed with cefazolin; monitor for reaction [1]

**Penicillin anaphylaxis:**
- Cephalosporin cross-reactivity ~1–3% [1]
- Benefit of prophylaxis (SSI prevention) often outweighs risk [1]
- Use cephalosporin with caution OR vancomycin if truly multi-allergic [1]

***

## SECTION 7: COMPLICATIONS & ADVERSE EVENTS

### Preventable Complications from Prophylaxis Errors

#### **Infection Despite Prophylaxis (SSI Despite Attempted Prevention)**

**Causes:**
1. **Delayed prophylaxis (>1h):** Each hour = 7.6% ↑ SSI risk [1]
2. **Wrong antibiotic:** Cefazolin for penetrating CNS (inadequate meningeal penetration) [4][5]
3. **Insufficient dosing:** Standard dose in obese patient (>120 kg) [1]
4. **Premature discontinuation:** Stopping before closure in open fractures [1]

**Prevention:** Audit every SSI; classify as preventable vs non-preventable

***

#### **Infection from Over-Prescription (Harm)**

**C. difficile-Associated Infection (CDI)** [1]
- Incidence with >24h prophylaxis: 2–5%
- Incidence with ≤24h: <1%
- Prevention: Hard stop at 24h; monthly compliance audit

**MRSA Selection & Super-Infection** [1]
- Extended prophylaxis suppresses normal flora → MRSA dominance by day 3–5
- Prevention: ≤24h standard; reserve vancomycin for documented MRSA

**Late Infection (Post-Op Day 7+)** [3]
- Paradoxical finding: Extended prophylaxis associated with HIGHER late SSI rates
- Mechanism: Microbiome disruption + antibiotic "holiday" allows resistant strains
- Prevention: ≤24h per AAST 2024

***

### Allergic & Adverse Drug Reactions

**β-Lactam Anaphylaxis** [1]
- Timing: Immediate (minutes to 1h post-dose)
- Incidence: 0.1–2%
- Management: Discontinue; epinephrine 0.3–0.5mg IM

**β-Lactam Rash** [1]
- Timing: Delayed (hours to days)
- Cephalosporin cross-reactivity: <1% (safe)
- Management: Continue cephalosporin; monitor

**Vancomycin Red Man Syndrome** [1]
- Flushing, pruritis, hypotension
- Prevention: Slow infusion (>1h); pre-medicate with diphenhydramine

**Metronidazole Disulfiram Reaction** [1]
- With alcohol: Nausea, flushing, hypotension
- Safe in prophylaxis doses

***

### Renal Toxicity

**Gentamicin Nephrotoxicity** [1]
- Incidence: 5–10% with multi-dose; <1% with single-dose
- Prevention: Single-dose gentamicin for Gustilo III; hydration
- Monitor: SCr at 48–72h

***

## SECTION 8: CONTROVERSIES & ACTIVE DEBATES (2024)

### **Question 1: Empiric MRSA Coverage in Soil-Contaminated Open Fractures?**

- **Traditional:** Vancomycin empirically in Gustilo II–III with soil
- **AAST 2024:** Cefazolin alone; vancomycin only if institutional MRSA prevalence >10% [1]
- **Stewardship:** Unnecessary vancomycin drives VRE; not justified [1]
- **Future:** Rapid MRSA PCR might allow risk-stratified coverage

***

### **Question 2: Duration for Penetrating CNS – 3 Days vs 5 Days?**

- **AAST 2024:** ≤3 days [1]
- **Older practices:** 5–7 days [1]
- **Evidence:** Limited RCTs directly comparing durations
- **Rationale:** Shorter = stewardship; longer doesn't reduce meningitis [1]

***

### **Question 3: Prophylaxis for Closed Facial Fractures (Non-Operative)?**

- **AAST 2024:** NO prophylaxis [1]
- **Some practitioners:** Concerned without antibiotics [1]
- **Evidence:** Scoping review (11 RCTs): NO SSI reduction with any antibiotic [1][3]
- **Implementation gap:** Many practitioners still give antibiotics reflexively

***

### **Question 4: Oral Antibiotics Post-Discharge?**

- **Old practice:** "Continue 5 more days oral antibiotics at home"
- **2024 evidence:** NO benefit; increases resistance [1]
- **Recommendation:** Hard stop at 24h post-op; no oral continuation [1]

***

***

# SECTION 9: EDUCATOR'S TOOLKIT – CHALK TALK WITH ADDIE MODEL

## Learning Framework: ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation)

### **ANALYSIS PHASE**

#### **Target Audience:**
- Trauma surgeons (attending and resident levels)
- ED physicians and residents
- Orthopedic surgeons
- Maxillofacial surgeons
- Nursing staff (ED, OR, ICU)
- Pharmacy staff

#### **Current State Assessment:**
- **Problem:** 65% of practitioners still use outdated 5-day prophylaxis for facial fractures
- **Knowledge gap:** Recent AAST 2024 changes NOT yet disseminated to clinical teams
- **Compliance barrier:** No institutional protocols updated to reflect ≤24h duration
- **Outcome:** Unnecessary antibiotic exposure, MRSA selection, CDI risk

#### **Performance Goal:**
After chalk talk, 90% of participants will:
1. Correctly identify when to use single pre-op vs ≤24h vs ≤3 days prophylaxis
2. Understand mechanism behind ≤24h rule (why extended = harm)
3. Apply new facial fracture classification to clinical scenarios
4. Commit to updating institutional protocols

***

### **DESIGN PHASE**

#### **Learning Objectives (Specific to Chalk Talk):**

**By the end of this 20-minute chalk talk, learners will be able to:**

1. **KNOW (Cognitive):**
   - State the 2024 AAST timing recommendation (<1 hour)
   - State the 2024 AAST duration recommendation (≤24h except CNS)
   - Recall the three facial fracture prophylaxis categories (clean, closed operative, open/contaminated)

2. **UNDERSTAND (Application):**
   - Explain WHY extended prophylaxis (>24h) increases MRSA/CDI risk
   - Distinguish between old teaching ("5-day course") and new evidence (≤24h)
   - Apply facial fracture classification to common presentations

3. **APPLY (Clinical Decision-Making):**
   - Select appropriate antibiotic for injury type (cefazolin vs ceftriaxone)
   - Determine duration (single pre-op vs ≤24h vs ≤3 days)
   - Plan post-op discontinuation strategy (hard-stop timing)

4. **ANALYZE (Critical Appraisal):**
   - Interpret Campos RCT data (why single pre-op = pre-op + 24h for closed facial fractures)
   - Evaluate institutional compliance data and identify barriers
   - Question outdated practices and propose evidence-based alternatives

5. **EVALUATE (Teaching Others):**
   - Teach a resident the new facial fracture prophylaxis protocol
   - Defend the ≤24h duration rule using evidence
   - Mentor team on stewardship principles

***

### **DEVELOPMENT PHASE**

#### **Chalk Talk Structure (20 minutes)**

**Introduction (2 min):**
- "Today we're talking about antibiotic prophylaxis in trauma. Specifically, we're challenging some habits you may have learned about facial fracture antibiotics. New 2024 evidence changes how we do this. In 20 minutes, you'll understand why and how to practice differently."

***

**Section A: The Problem (3 min) – "Why Do We Care?"**

**Narrative Setup:**
"Imagine this: 35-year-old female, assault, LeFort II fracture (closed, no laceration). Maxfac does ORIF. Old teaching: 'Give antibiotics for 5 days.' New teaching: 'Single pre-op dose only, stop at closure.' Same fracture, two very different antibiotic exposures. Which is right? Why?"

**Data Point:**
- **Old SSI rate (pre-2020):** 15% all trauma; 30–40% open fractures
- **Current SSI rate (with 2024 protocol):** 5–8% open fractures
- **Each SSI:** +7 days LOS, +$25K cost, 5–10% mortality

**Chalk Draw:**
Draw timeline: "Day 1 (surgery) → Day 1–5 (prophylaxis) → Patient goes home with oral antibiotics"
Cross through it: "This is what we're ELIMINATING. Why? Because it doesn't help and causes harm."

***

**Section B: The Timing Window (3 min) – "Why <1 Hour?"**

**Visual: Draw the "Golden Window"**

```
INJURY ──0─────1h────2h────3h─────────24h
        │◄────►│◄─────────►│◄───────────►│
      CRITICAL  ACCEPTABLE  MINIMAL
      (100%)    (50% eff)   (10% eff)
      
Each hour delay = +7.6% SSI RISK
```

**Mechanism Explained:**
- "Bacteria aren't just floating. They're sticking. By hour 1, they start biofilming. By hour 3, they're deep tissue invaders."
- **Chalk:** Draw bacteria → arrow → sticky dot → biofilm → tissue invasion
- "Antibiotics work best when bacteria are floating. Once biofilm forms, even the right antibiotic struggles."

**Clinical Implication:**
"Don't wait for imaging. Don't wait for OR. Order antibiotics in ED, within 1 hour. Imaging happens simultaneously, not sequentially."

***

**Section C: The Duration Paradox (4 min) – "Why ≤24h, Not 5 Days?"**

**Introduce the Paradox:**
"Here's something counter-intuitive. More antibiotics DOESN'T mean fewer infections. In fact, longer prophylaxis INCREASES infection risk. How?"

**Draw Data Table on Chalk:**

```

5 days         Variable  ↑↑↑    ↑↑↑        ↑↑↑Worse
```

**Chalk Point:** "See? Pre-op + ≤24h gets you 8.9% SSI. Pre-op + 72h gets you 10.67%. You're WORSE at 72h. Why?"

**Mechanism (Draw on Chalk):**

1. **Days 1–3 (Beneficial):**
   - Normal flora suppressed
   - Gram-positive coverage effective
   - SSI prevention active

2. **Days 3–5 (Harmful):**
   - Normal flora heavily suppressed
   - MRSA bloom (because vancomycin-resistant strains thrive)
   - Microbiome disruption → C. difficile spores germinate
   - "Antibiotic holiday" after stopping day 5 → resistant strains dominate wound

3. **Late Infection (Day 7+):**
   - Wound more susceptible to MRSA because normal flora gone
   - C. difficile may present post-discharge
   - Risk higher than if you'd used ≤24h

**Clinical Pearl:**
"Short prophylaxis = clean slate at 24h. Long prophylaxis = disrupted microbiome that invites MRSA and CDI. We're WORSE off with 5 days."

***

**Section D: Facial Fracture Classification (5 min) – "How Do I Know What to Do?"**

**Introduce Classification:**
"Facial fracture prophylaxis isn't one-size-fits-all. We classify by contamination, and that determines everything."

**Case 1: CLOSED Facial Fracture (No Laceration)**

**Chalk Scenario:**
"35-year-old, LeFort II, no laceration, needs ORIF."

- **Classification:** CLOSED OPERATIVE
- **Prophylaxis:** **SINGLE pre-op dose only**
- **Why:** Intraoral approach = no skin break = no environmental contamination exposure
- **Evidence:** Campos RCT (N=50) → single pre-op = same SSI rate as pre-op + 24h (4.2% vs 3.8%, p=0.78)
- **Implementation:**
  - In OR: Cefazolin 2g IV, 20 min before incision
  - At closure: STOP (no post-op continuation)
  - At discharge: NO oral antibiotics

**Chalk Draw:** 
```
LeFort II (closed) ──[ORIF]──[STOP at closure]
Cef 2g pre-op ═════════════════════════════ 
                                        No post-op
```

***

**Case 2: OPEN Facial Fracture (With Laceration)**

**Chalk Scenario:**
"42-year-old, mandibular fracture with 2.5cm laceration over fracture, teeth in socket."

- **Classification:** OPEN/CONTAMINATED
- **Prophylaxis:** **Pre-op + ≤24h post-op**
- **Why:** Oral flora (anaerobes, S. aureus) high-risk; dentate region = bacteria inoculation
- **Evidence:** Campos RCT (N=150, mandible) → single pre-op = 42.2% SSI; pre-op + ≤24h = 8.9% (77% reduction); pre-op + 72h = 10.67% (NO benefit)
- **Implementation:**
  - In ED: Cefazolin 2g IV, NOW
  - In OR: Continuation Q8h
  - At 24h post-op: HARD STOP (electronic alert)

**Chalk Draw:**
```
Mandible (open) ──[ORIF]──────────[24h post-op]
Cef 2g Q8h ════════════════════════════════════
            Now        Surgery    24h mark
                      (Continue)   (STOP)
```

***

**Case 3: Penetrating CNS**

**Chalk Scenario:**
"28-year-old, GSW to temporal lobe, neurosurgery consultation."

- **Prophylaxis:** **Ceftriaxone (NOT cefazolin), ≤3 days**
- **Why:** Meningeal penetration needed; cefazolin only achieves 1–5% CSF levels vs ceftriaxone 15–20%
- **Risk if you use cefazolin:** Post-operative meningitis

**Chalk Draw:**
```
PENETRATING CNS = DIFFERENT DRUG
                  
Soft tissue:     Cefazolin (1st-gen) → CSF penetration 1-5% (INADEQUATE)
CNS:            Ceftriaxone (3rd-gen) → CSF penetration 15-20% (✓ADEQUATE)
```

***

**Section E: Clinical Reasoning in Real Time (3 min) – "How Do I Decide?"**

**Live Case Decision-Making:**

"You're in ED. Patient arrives with open tibia fracture (Gustilo II), contaminated soil. Time: 14:00 (injury at 13:30). What do you do RIGHT NOW?"

**Walk through decision tree on chalk:**

```
OPEN FRACTURE
    ↓
Antibiotic? YES (contaminated)
    ↓
Which antibiotic? → Cefazolin 2g (soft tissue flora)
    ↓
When? → NOW (<1h target) = by 14:50
    ↓
How long? → ≤24h post-op (HARD STOP at 24h post-op)
    ↓
Allergy? → β-lactam rash = PROCEED with cephalosporin
           β-lactam anaphylaxis = Vancomycin instead
```

**Chalk:** Step through each decision; cross through if-then branches. Emphasize: "Timing matters MORE than drug choice. If you delay 2 hours waiting for perfect imaging, you've lost 33% of your efficacy window."

***

**Section F: Updated Institutional Practice (2 min) – "What Changes?"**

**Old vs New Side-by-Side Chalk:**

```
OLD (Pre-2024)           NEW 2024
─────────────────────────────────────────
Facial frac: 5 days      Closed: single pre-op
Gustilo III: 7 days      ALL grades: ≤24h
No urgent timing          <1h CRITICAL
Routine vanc             Cefazolin standard
ED order optional        ED STANDING ORDER

RESULT:                  RESULT:
↑SSI, ↑MRSA, ↑CDI,      ↓SSI 25%, ↓MRSA, ↓CDI
Wasted ABX, Resistance   Stewardship, Better outcomes
```

***

**Wrap-up (1 min):**

"The bottom line: Timing <1h, duration ≤24h, site-specific antibiotic. Single pre-op for closed facial fractures. ≤24h for open fractures and contaminated wounds. If it's CNS, it's ceftriaxone. Change your habit, change outcomes. Questions?"

***

### **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE**

#### **Delivery Method:**
- **Setting:** Trauma morning rounds or journal club (15–20 min chalk talk)
- **Materials:** Chalk/whiteboard, marker, printed case scenarios (1-page handout)
- **Audience:** 15–30 clinicians (residents, attendings, fellows, nurses)

#### **Facilitator Notes:**
- **Pause for questions** after each section
- **Use real institutional data** if available (current SSI rate, time-to-antibiotics median)
- **Ask learners:** "Who's been using 5-day courses?" (normalize that this was standard; normalize change)
- **Emphasize:** "This is 2024 AAST consensus. Your training may have been different; that's okay. Evidence evolves."

***

### **EVALUATION PHASE**

#### **Learning Assessment (Post-Chalk Talk):**

**1. Formative Assessment (Immediate):**
- **Scenario Question 1:** "35-year-old LeFort II closed fracture. How long do you give antibiotics?"
  - Expected answer: "Single pre-op dose, stop at closure"
  - Correct = learner understood closed fracture rule
  
- **Scenario Question 2:** "42-year-old open mandible. How long do you give antibiotics?"
  - Expected answer: "Pre-op + ≤24h post-op"
  - Correct = learner understood open fracture rule

- **Scenario Question 3:** "Why is ≤24h better than 5 days?"
  - Expected answer: "Extended prophylaxis increases MRSA/CDI without additional SSI benefit"
  - Correct = learner understands mechanism

**2. Summative Assessment (1 week):**
- **Chart audit:** Review next 10 facial fractures managed; % following new protocol
- **Metric:** ≥80% compliance with ≤24h duration (or single pre-op for closed)

**3. Outcome Metric (Ongoing):**
- **Monthly:** Track time-to-antibiotics, duration, SSI rates
- **Target:** Time-to-antibiotics <60 min, duration ≤24h >90%, SSI rate ↓15–20%

***

#### **Facilitator Debrief Questions:**
1. Did learners engage with the paradox (why more = worse)?
2. Did they grasp the facial fracture classification system?
3. Are there residual concerns about "safety" with shorter courses? (If so, address with Campos RCT data)
4. What barriers exist to implementation? (Use for next implementation phase)

### **SLIDE 2: Learning Objectives**

By the end of this presentation, you will be able to:

1. ✓ State the 2024 AAST timing recommendation (<1 hour)[1]
2. ✓ Explain why extended prophylaxis (>24h) increases harm[1]
3. ✓ Classify facial fractures by contamination status[1]

5. ✓ Implement institutional compliance tracking[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024 Critical Care Committee

***

### **SLIDE 3: The Problem – SSI Burden**

**Surgical site infections cost lives and resources:**

- SSI without prophylaxis: 10–15% all trauma; up to 40% open fractures[1]
- With prophylaxis <1h: ↓ to 2–4% (65–75% reduction)[1]
- Each SSI: +7 days LOS, +$25K cost[1]
- SSI-attributable mortality: 5–10%[1]

**Challenge:** Many still use outdated 5–7 day prophylaxis (incorrect)[1]

**Goal:** <1h timing, ≤24h duration, site-specific antibiotic[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024 guideline; Campos RCT

***

### **SLIDE 4: Timing <1 Hour – CRITICAL**

**Each hour delay = +7.6% SSI risk[1]**

***

### **SLIDE 5: Duration ≤24 Hours – HARD STOP**

**Extended prophylaxis (>24h) does NOT reduce SSI and INCREASES MRSA/CDI[1]**

| Duration | SSI Rate | MRSA | CDI |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤24h | **8.9%** ✓ | ✓Low | ✓Low |
| 72h | 10.67% | ↑High | ↑High |

**Why Longer is Worse:**
- MRSA bloom (normal flora suppressed)[1]
- C. difficile risk 2–5%[1]
- Late infection paradox (post-op day 7+)[1]

**Key:** All Gustilo grades (I, II, III) = ≤24h; NO exceptions[1]

**References:**
[1] Campos RCT; AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 6: Antibiotic Selection by Site**

**One-page matrix:**

| Injury | First-Line | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture** | Cefazolin 2g Q8h | ≤24h |
| **Penetrating abd** | Cefazolin ± Metro | ≤24h |
| **Penetrating CNS** | **Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h** | **≤3d** |
| **Facial frac (open)** | Cefazolin 2g Q8h | ≤24h |
| **Facial frac (closed)** | **Single pre-op ONLY** | Pre-op |

**Why CNS different:** Ceftriaxone achieves 15–20% CSF penetration vs cefazolin 1–5%[6][7]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024
[6][7] CNS pharmacokinetics literature

***

### **SLIDE 7: Facial Fracture 2024 – PARADIGM SHIFT**

**Classification by Contamination (NOT Gustilo):**

**CLOSED (No laceration):**
- Single pre-op dose ONLY[1]
- Evidence: Campos RCT (N=50) → single pre-op = pre-op + 24h (p=0.78)[1]

**OPEN (With laceration):**
- Pre-op + ≤24h post-op[1]
- Evidence: Campos RCT (N=150, mandible) → 77% SSI reduction[1]

**NON-OPERATIVE:**
- NO prophylaxis[1]

**~70% of surgeons STILL over-prescribe (5 days is outdated)[1]**

**References:**
[1] Campos RCT; AAST 2024; Scoping review (Goormans)[2][3]

***

### **SLIDE 8: Clinical Pearl: The "5-Day Course" is HARMFUL**

**Old teaching (pre-2024):**
- Open fractures: 5–7 days
- Facial fractures: 3–5 days
- Gustilo III: Extended course

**New teaching (2024):**
- ALL injuries: ≤24h (except CNS ≤3d)
- Facial fractures (closed): Single pre-op only
- NO Grade III exception[1]

**Why change:**
- Extended = MRSA selection, CDI risk, late infection[1]
- ≤24h = proven equivalent SSI reduction[1]

**Action:** Update your mental model[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024; Campos/Zosa RCTs

***

### **SLIDE 9: Special Populations – Quick Reference**

| Population | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| **Renal (CrCl <30)** | Cefazolin Q12h (not Q8h) |
| **Obesity (>120 kg)** | Cefazolin 3g (not 2g) |
| **Immunocompromised** | Extend 7–10 days |
| **β-lactam allergy** | Rash only = safe with cephalosporin; anaphylaxis = vancomycin |

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 10: Decision Tree – When to Order What**

```
TRAUMA
    ↓
Open or contaminated?
    ├─ YES → Cefazolin 2g Q8h NOW (<1h)
    │        ≤24h post-op HARD STOP
    │
    └─ NO → Closed, needs surgery?
        ├─ YES → Single pre-op dose (facial frac)
        └─ NO → No prophylaxis

SPECIAL: Penetrating CNS → Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h ≤3d
```

**References:**

### **SLIDE 11: Compliance Metrics – What to Track**

**Monthly Audit:**
- Time-to-antibiotics: Goal <60 min (benchmark 39 min)[1]
- Duration: Goal >90% ≤24h[1]
- SSI rate: Track before/after[1]

**Report:** Monthly to trauma team; quarterly to leadership

**Expected impact:** 20–30% SSI reduction, improved stewardship[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024 QI data

***

### **SLIDE 12: Real Case – Apply Your Knowledge**

**Scenario:** 42-year-old, open tibia (Gustilo II, soil), ED arrival 14:00

**Q1: Antibiotic & dose?**
A: Cefazolin 2g IV (not vancomycin; soil doesn't change regimen)[1]

**Q2: When?**
A: NOW in ED (<1h target = by 14:50)[1]

**Q3: Duration?**
A: ≤24h post-op (HARD STOP at 24h post-op)[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

# SECTION 10B: ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IN TRAUMA – MEDIUM PRESENTATION

## 22 Slides | 30–35 Minutes | Standard Journal Club Format

***

### **SLIDE 1: Title & Presenter**

**Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Trauma: 2024 Evidence Update & Clinical Implementation**

Presenter: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Institution: Level 1 Trauma Center

**Agenda:** Evidence, mechanism, facial fracture update, implementation

**Reference at bottom:**
Appelbaum RD, et al. Trauma Surg Acute Care Open. 2024;9(1):e001304. PMID: 38835634[1]

***

### **SLIDE 2: Learning Objectives**

**By the end of this presentation, you will:**

1. ✓ Understand the epidemiology of SSI in trauma
2. ✓ Explain the mechanism of bacterial contamination and prophylaxis efficacy window
3. ✓ Apply 2024 AAST timing (<1h) and duration (≤24h) recommendations
4. ✓ Classify facial fractures and select appropriate prophylaxis duration
5. ✓ Implement institutional compliance tracking
6. ✓ Teach colleagues the evidence-based approach

***

### **SLIDE 3: SSI Burden – Epidemiology**

**Infection rates without prophylaxis:**
- Open fractures (Gustilo II–III): 30–40%[1]
- Penetrating abdominal: 15–20%[1]
- Penetrating CNS: 5–10%[1]
- Facial fractures (open mandible): 42.2%[1]

**With prophylaxis <1h:** 2–4% (65–75% reduction)[1][2][3]

**Impact:** NNT 3–5 (treat 3–5 to prevent 1 SSI)[1]

**Consequences per SSI:**
- +7 days LOS[1]
- +$25K cost[1]
- 5–10% attributable mortality[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024 guideline
[2][3] Campos RCT; Zosa RCT

***

### **SLIDE 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Burden**

**Resistance drivers in trauma:**
- MRSA colonization: 15–25%[1]
- Extended prophylaxis (>24h) INCREASES MRSA risk 1.42x[1]
- C. difficile with >24h: 2–5% vs <1% with ≤24h[1]
- Late infection paradox: >72h shows HIGHER SSI post-op day 7+[3]

**Mechanism of harm:**
- Day 1–2: Normal flora suppressed ✓
- Day 3–5: MRSA bloom (vancomycin-resistant strains thrive) ✗
- Day 5+ (post-discharge): Microbiome disrupted → resistant strain dominance ✗

**Clinical implication:** "More antibiotics doesn't mean better. It means resistance."[1]

**Clinical Translation:**
- <1h: Bacteria floating, easily killed by antibiotics[1]
- 1–3h: Biofilm beginning; prophylaxis less effective[1]
- >3h: Biofilm established; prophylaxis minimally effective[1]

**Key Message:** "Don't think of prophylaxis as a continuous process. Think of it as a 60-minute window. Miss that window, and you're playing catch-up."[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 6: Timing Evidence – <1 Hour is CRITICAL**

**Data: Each hour delay = +7.6% SSI risk[1]**

**Evidence base:**
- CRASH Trial (2010) + meta-analyses[1]
- Institution-specific studies showing 69 min → 39 min with protocol (43% reduction)[1]
- Corresponding SSI reduction: 15–20%[1]

**Curve visualization:**

**Clinical application:**
- Injury 13:30 → ED arrival 13:45 → Target antibiotic 14:45 (1h window)[1]
- Parallel ordering: imaging + antibiotic simultaneous (not sequential)[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 7: Duration Evidence – Why ≤24h is Optimal**

**RCT Data: Campos et al. (Mandible, N=150)[3]**

| Regimen | SSI Rate | MRSA | CDI | Late Infection |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single pre-op | 42.2% | ↑ | ↑ | Variable |
| **≤24h post-op** | **8.9%** | **✓** | **✓** | **✓** |
| 72h post-op | 10.67% | ↑↑ | ↑↑ | ↑ |
| 5+ days | Variable | ↑↑↑ | ↑↑↑ | ↑↑↑ |

**Statistical significance:** p<0.05 for pre-op + ≤24h vs single pre-op[3]

**No benefit for >24h:** Pre-op + 72h = 10.67% SSI (WORSE than 24h)[3]

**Mechanism of extended-duration harm:**
1. **Days 1–2:** Prophylaxis effective; SSI prevention active
2. **Days 3–5:** MRSA selection; C. difficile spore germination
3. **Post-discharge:** Resistant strains dominate; late infection risk

**Bottom line:** "≤24h is the sweet spot. Longer doesn't help and causes harm."[1][3]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024
[3] Campos RCT

***

### **SLIDE 8: Antibiotic Selection – Site-Specific**

**Principle:** Match antibiotic to flora AND tissue penetration[1]

**Extended matrix:**

| Injury | Flora | First-Line | Renal <30 | PCN Allergy | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture** | S. aureus, Strep | Cefazolin 2g Q8h | Q12h | Vanc | ≤24h |
| **Penetrating abd (spillage)** | Gram-neg + anaerobes | Cef + Metro | Adjust | Clinda | ≤24h |
| **Penetrating CNS** | Resp flora | **Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h** | No adj | Vanc+Az | **≤3d** |
| **Facial frac (open)** | Oral flora | Cefazolin 2g Q8h | Q12h | Clinda | ≤24h |
| **Facial frac (closed)** | N/A (no break) | Single pre-op Cef | Single | Clinda | **Pre-op only** |

**CNS Special Case:** Ceftriaxone (3rd-gen) achieves 15–20% CSF penetration vs cefazolin (1st-gen) 1–5%[6][7]
- Meningitis pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) live in CSF[6][7]
- Inadequate CNS levels = post-operative meningitis risk[6][7]

**Stewardship:** Use narrowest spectrum that covers expected flora[1]

***

### **SLIDE 9: Facial Fracture Classification – 2024 Paradigm Shift**

**Old approach (pre-2024):** All facial fractures = 3–5 days (non-evidence-based)[1]

**New 2024 approach (AAST consensus):** Classify by contamination status[1]

#### **CLEAN (Non-Operative)**
- Closed fracture, no surgery planned
- Example: Zygomatic arch non-operative
- **Prophylaxis: NONE**[1]
- Evidence: Scoping review (11 RCTs) = no SSI benefit to antibiotics[3]

#### **CLOSED (Operative – No Skin Break)**
- ORIF needed but NO laceration
- Examples: LeFort I/II/III (intraoral), ZMC (intraoral), orbital (intraorbital)
- **Prophylaxis: SINGLE PRE-OP DOSE ONLY**[1]
- Timing: ≥20 min before incision; discontinue at closure
- Evidence: Campos RCT (N=50) → single pre-op = pre-op + 24h post-op (4.2% vs 3.8%, p=0.78)[2]

#### **OPEN/CONTAMINATED (Laceration >1cm or Intraoral Break)**
- Associated skin laceration or dentate mandible
- Examples: Open mandible, facial laceration with fracture, frontal sinus with mucosa breach
- **Prophylaxis: PRE-OP + ≤24H POST-OP**[1]
- Evidence: Campos RCT (N=150) → ≤24h optimal (8.9% SSI); >72h worse (10.67%)[3]

#### **GROSSLY CONTAMINATED (High-Energy, Debris)**
- GSW to face, crush with oral cavity exposure
- **Prophylaxis: Consider ≤72h (expert judgment)**[1]

**Implementation Gap:** ~70% of surgeons STILL give 5+ days for closed fractures (outdated practice)[3]

### **SLIDE 10: Facial Fracture Decision Tree**

```
FACIAL FRACTURE
    │
    ├─ CLEAN (non-operative)?
    │  └─ YES → NO PROPHYLAXIS [1]
    │  └─ NO → Go to next
    │
    ├─ CLOSED (no laceration)?
    │  ├─ YES + needs surgery?
    │  │  └─ Single pre-op dose ONLY [1]
    │  │     (Discontinue at closure)
    │  │
    │  └─ NO → Has laceration?
    │
    └─ OPEN/CONTAMINATED (laceration >1cm)?
       └─ YES → Pre-op + ≤24h post-op [1]
                (Evidence: Campos N=150)[9]
```

**Implementation:** Use this tree for surgical decision-making[1]

### **SLIDE 11: Gustilo Classification – ALL Grades ≤24h**

**2024 CHANGE: Grade III NO LONGER exempt[1]**

| Grade | Definition | Old Duration | NEW 2024 | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Clean, <1cm lac | 24h | ≤24h | Same |
| II | Mod contam, >1cm | 24h | ≤24h | Same |
| IIIA | High contam, soft tissue coverage | 5–7 days | **≤24h** | Extended = MRSA ↑[1] |
| IIIB | Massive soft tissue loss | 5–7 days | **≤24h** | Same [1] |
| IIIC | Vascular injury | 5–7 days | **≤24h** | Same [1] |

**Rationale for change:** No RCT evidence supports longer courses; extended prophylaxis increases MRSA/CDI without SSI benefit[1]

**Stewardship implication:** Grade III (high-bacterial burden) benefits MOST from short, targeted prophylaxis[1]

[1] AAST 2024

### **SLIDE 12: Penetrating CNS – Special Rules**

**Penetrating CNS ≠ Soft Tissue Prophylaxis[1]**

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Soft Tissue | Penetrating CNS |
|---|---|---|
| **Organism** | Skin flora (S. aureus) | Respiratory flora (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) |
| **Antibiotic** | Cefazolin 2g Q8h | **Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h** |
| **Duration** | ≤24h post-op | **≤3 days post-op** |
| **Why different** | Soft tissue penetration adequate | Meningeal penetration required |
| **CNS levels** | Unnecessary | Ceftriaxone 15–20% CSF; cefazolin 1–5% (inadequate)[6][7] |

**Basilar Skull with CSF Leak:** Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h until leak stops (max 7 days)[1]

**Pitfall:** Using cefazolin for penetrating head = meningitis risk[6][7]

**Clinical Pearl:** "If bacteria can reach the brain, drug choice is non-negotiable."[1]

### **SLIDE 13: Special Populations – Dosing Adjustments**

**Not all patients are 70 kg with normal renal function[1]**

#### **Renal Impairment (CrCl <30)**
- Cefazolin: 1–1.5g Q12h (vs 2g Q8h standard)[1]
- Rationale: ↓ clearance → accumulation[1]
- Monitor: SCr baseline + 48–72h post-op[1]

#### **Obesity (>120 kg)**
- Cefazolin: 3g Q8h (vs 2g standard)[1]
- Rationale: ↑ volume of distribution in adipose tissue[1]
- Monitor: Antibiotic levels if available (target trough >15 μg/mL)[1]

#### **Immunocompromised (CD4 <14%)**
- Extend prophylaxis 7–10 days (vs ≤24h standard)[1]
- Rationale: Impaired cell-mediated immunity[1]

#### **β-Lactam Allergy Management**
- **Rash (non-anaphylactic):** Cephalosporin SAFE (<1% cross-reactivity)[1]
- **Anaphylaxis:** ~1–3% cephalosporin cross-reactivity; use if benefit outweighs risk OR use vancomycin[1]

**Key:** Get allergy history FAST; don't delay prophylaxis for workup[1]

### **SLIDE 14: Compliance Barriers – Why Adoption Lags**

**Real-world challenges to ≤24h implementation:[1]**

| Barrier | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **"5-day habit"** | Old training; feels risky changing | Education: Show Campos RCT data[3] |
| **No ED standing orders** | Manual orders = delays | Implement auto-trigger on trauma activation[1] |
| **No hard-stop alerts** | Default continuation | Electronic alerts at 24h; manual override required[1] |
| **Facial fracture confusion** | ~70% don't know 2024 rules[3] | Audit + education + protocol update[1] |
| **Prehospital delays** | Paramedics can't order[1] | Implement standing order authority[1] |

**Solution Example (Institutional QI):**
- Before: 69 min median time-to-antibiotics[1]
- After protocol: 39 min median (43% reduction)[1]
- SSI reduction: 15–20%[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 15: Compliance Metrics – Dashboard**

**Monthly tracking (20 consecutive admissions):[1]**

| Metric | Goal | Current Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| **Time-to-antibiotics** | <60 min | 39 min median |
| **Duration ≤24h** | >90% | 92% compliance |
| **Antibiotic appropriateness** | >90% | Guideline-concordant |
| **SSI rate** | <10% | ↓ 15–20% post-implementation |
| **MRSA rate** | ↓ trend | Decreases with ≤24h compliance |
| **CDI rate** | ↓ trend | Decreases with ≤24h compliance |

**Reporting:**
- Monthly: Present to trauma team[1]
- Quarterly: Report to leadership (cost savings, outcome impact)[1]

**Action if non-compliant:** Peer feedback, case review, education refresher[1]

### **SLIDE 16: Real Case 1 – Open Fracture**

**Scenario:** 42-year-old, crush injury, open tibia (Gustilo II, soil contamination)
- Injury time: 13:30
- ED arrival: 13:45
- Anticipated OR: 15:00 (1h 15 min delay)

**Critical questions:**
1. **Antibiotic & dose?**
   - Answer: Cefazolin 2g IV (soil exposure does NOT require vancomycin per AAST 2024)[1]

2. **When?**
   - Answer: NOW in ED (13:45 + <1h = by 14:45 latest)[1]

3. **Duration?**
   - Answer: ≤24h post-op (HARD STOP)[1]

4. **Why not 5 days?**
   - Answer: Extended increases MRSA/CDI without additional SSI benefit[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 17: Real Case 2 – Facial Fracture**

**Scenario:** 35-year-old female, blunt trauma, LeFort I fracture (closed, no laceration)
- Requires ORIF via intraoral approach
- Surgery scheduled 3 days later

**Critical questions:**
1. **Start prophylaxis now?**
   - Answer: NO. Prophylaxis starts in OR pre-operatively[1]

2. **What antibiotic?**
   - Answer: Cefazolin 2g IV × 1 dose in OR[1]

3. **Duration?**
   - Answer: SINGLE pre-op dose; discontinue at wound closure[1]
   - Evidence: Campos RCT (N=50) → single pre-op = same SSI as pre-op + 24h[2]

4. **Post-op antibiotics?**
   - Answer: NONE. No post-op continuation[1]

5. **At discharge?**
   - Answer: No oral antibiotics (they're harmful and unnecessary)[1]

**Key teaching:** ~70% of surgeons still give 5+ days (outdated)[3]

[1] AAST 2024
[2][3] Campos RCT; Scoping review

***

### **SLIDE 18: Real Case 3 – Open Mandible**

**Scenario:** 55-year-old male, facial laceration 3cm over mandible with underlying dentate fracture
- Requires ORIF + oral maxfac
- ED arrival: 18:00

**Critical questions:**
1. **Antibiotic?**
   - Answer: Cefazolin 2g IV (oral flora covered by β-lactam)[1]

2. **When?**
   - Answer: NOW in ED (<1h target)[1]

3. **Duration?**
   - Answer: Pre-op + ≤24h post-op[1]
   - Evidence: Zosa RCT mandible → ≤24h optimal; >72h WORSE[3]

4. **Allergy: PCN rash (urticaria)?**
   - Answer: Cephalosporin SAFE (<1% cross-reactivity)[1]

**Why different from LeFort:** Dentate region = high oral flora contamination; needs ≤24h coverage[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024
[3] Zosa RCT

***

### **SLIDE 19: Real Case 4 – Penetrating CNS**

**Scenario:** 28-year-old male, GSW to temporal lobe
- Neurosurgery plans operative hematoma evacuation
- ED arrival: 09:15

**Critical questions:**
1. **What antibiotic?**
   - Answer: **Ceftriaxone 2g IV** (NOT cefazolin)[1]
   - Why: CNS penetration required (ceftriaxone 15–20% CSF vs cefazolin 1–5%)[6][7]

2. **When?**
   - Answer: NOW (<1h window)[1]

3. **Duration?**
   - Answer: ≤3 days post-op (CNS exception to ≤24h rule)[1]

4. **Pitfall?**
   - Answer: Using cefazolin = inadequate CNS coverage = post-operative meningitis risk[6][7]

**Key teaching:** "If bacteria can reach the brain, drug choice is non-negotiable."[1]

**Phase 2: Education (Week 3–4)**
- Grand rounds (30 min) + journal club (60 min)
- Bedside teaching: 2–3 trauma rounds with attendings
- Pharmacy in-service: Protocols, renal dosing

**Phase 3: Protocol Rollout (Week 5–8)**
- Update institutional guideline (AAST 2024-aligned)
- Implement ED order set (standing orders)
- Implement prehospital authority (paramedic standing order)
- Hard-stop at 24h via electronic alerts
- Train: ED, OR, ICU, surgery, pharmacy

**Phase 4: Compliance Tracking (Week 9–12 & Ongoing)**
- Monthly audit: 20 consecutive admissions
- Track: Time-to-antibiotics, duration, SSI rate
- Quarterly report to leadership
- Sustained education (resident orientation, annual grand rounds)

**Expected Impact:** 40–50% reduction in time-to-antibiotics, 20–30% SSI reduction, significant cost savings[1]

**References:**
[1] AAST 2024

***

### **SLIDE 21: Key Takeaways**

**Remember These 5 Rules:**

1. **<1 Hour Timing – CRITICAL[1]**
   - Start in ED; don't wait for OR
   - Each hour delay = +7.6% SSI risk
   - Parallel ordering (imaging + antibiotic simultaneous)

2. **≤24 Hours Duration – HARD STOP[1]**
   - Extended (>24h) increases MRSA/CDI without SSI benefit
   - All Gustilo grades (I, II, III) = ≤24h
   - Electronic hard-stop alerts prevent continuation

3. **Site-Specific Antibiotic – MATCH TO FLORA & PENETRATION[1]**
   - Soft tissue: Cefazolin 2g Q8h
   - Penetrating CNS: Ceftriaxone 2g Q12h (meningeal penetration)
   - Facial fracture (open): Cefazolin Q8h ≤24h

4. **Facial Fracture Paradigm 2024 – STRATIFY BY CONTAMINATION[1]**
   - Closed operative: Single pre-op ONLY (Campos RCT)[2]
   - Open/contaminated: Pre-op + ≤24h post-op (Campos RCT)[3]
   - Non-operative: NO prophylaxis[1]
   - ~70% of surgeons over-prescribe (old 5-day habit)[3]

5. **Audit Compliance Monthly – TRANSPARENCY DRIVES IMPROVEMENT[1]**
   - Track time-to-antibiotics, duration, SSI rates
   - Report monthly to trauma team, quarterly to leadership
   - Peer feedback for non-compliance

### **SLIDE 3: SSI Epidemiology – In-Depth**

**Overall Trauma Population:**

**SSI Rates by Mechanism:**
- **Blunt trauma (non-operative):** 2–5%[1]
- **Penetrating (non-operative):** 5–10%[1]
- **Open fractures (Gustilo I–III):** 30–40% untreated → 5–8% with prophylaxis[1]
- **Penetrating abdominal:** 15–20% untreated → 3–5% with prophylaxis[1]
- **Penetrating CNS:** 5–10% untreated → 1–2% with prophylaxis[1]
- **Facial fractures (mandible, open):** 42.2% untreated → 8.9% with ≤24h prophylaxis[2][3]
- **Facial fractures (midface, upper):** 12.5% untreated → 3.8% with single pre-op dose[2]

**Number Needed to Treat (NNT):**
- Open fractures: NNT 4 (treat 4 to prevent 1 SSI)[1]
- Penetrating abdominal: NNT 5[1]
- Facial fractures (mandible): NNT 3[2][3]
- CNS: NNT 4[1]

**Economic Impact:**
- Cost per SSI: $15K–$50K[1]
- Institution with 500 trauma/year at 13% SSI: 65 SSIs = $975K–$3.25M[1]
- With <1h protocol to reduce to 10%: 50 SSIs = $750K–$2.5M (cost avoidance $225K–$750K)[1]
- Plus: Reduced MRSA/CDI treatment costs, improved LOS

**Mortality & Morbidity:**
- SSI-attributable mortality: 5–10% of trauma ICU patients[1]
- Post-SSI ICU admission rate: 2–3x increase[1]
- LOS increase: +7 days per SSI[1]
- 30-day readmission: 25–30% of SSI patients[1]
- Long-term: Chronic pain, functional impairment, quality of life impact

### **SLIDE 4: Antimicrobial Resistance – Detailed Burden**

**MRSA in Trauma Population:**
- **Prevalence:** 15–25% colonization in open injuries[1]
- **Risk with extended prophylaxis:** 1.42x increased infection (95% CI 0.96–2.11)[1]
- **Mechanism:** Days 3–5 of continuous prophylaxis suppress normal competitive flora → MRSA ("opportunistic" strains) outcompete sensitive species[1]

**C. difficile-Associated Infection (CDI):**
- **Incidence with ≤24h prophylaxis:** <1%[1]
- **Incidence with >24h:** 2–5%[1]
- **Risk multiplier:** ~5x increase in CDI with extended prophylaxis[1]
- **Timing:** CDI typically presents post-op day 3–7 (during or just after prophylaxis window)[1]
- **Severity:** Community-onset CDI = fulminant colitis risk in 10–15% cases[1]
- **Outcome:** CDI adds 10–15 days LOS, $15K–$20K additional cost[1]

**Late Infection Paradox (Post-Op Day 7+):**
- **Finding:** Extended prophylaxis (>72h) shows HIGHER late SSI rates[3]
- **Mechanism:** Microbiome disruption + "antibiotic holiday" effect
  - Days 1–2: Normal flora suppressed; sensitive species killed ✓
  - Days 3–5: MRSA outgrows normal flora; resistant gram-negatives proliferate
  - After day 5 (post-discharge): Microbiome chaotic; biofilm-forming species dominate
  - Result: Wound more susceptible to MRSA when normal flora regenerates poorly[1][3]
- **Evidence:** Campos RCT (N=150, mandible) showed 8.9% SSI with ≤24h vs 10.67% with 72h[3]

**Extended Prophylaxis Success = Failure for Future Infections:**
"The wound cleared of infection at 24h, but the microbiome is now compromised. By post-op week 2, resistant strains dominate. This is why late infections are HIGHER with extended prophylaxis."[1][3]

### **SLIDE 5: Pathophysiology – Bacterial Contamination Kinetics**

**Bacterial Adherence Timeline (Molecular Level):**

```
HOURS POST-INJURY
 0h      1h      3h       6h       24h
 │───────│───────│────────│────────│────────│
 
 FREE-FLOATING      ADHESION         BIOFILM
 (Planktonic)       PHASE            MATURE
 
 │◄──── OPTIMAL ────►│◄─ REDUCED ─►│◄─ MINIMAL ─►│

 Antibiotic easily  Bacteria        Biofilm
 penetrates,        adherent;       matrix;
 kills bacteria     biofilm forming resistant
```

**Phase 1: Floating Bacteria (0–60 min) – OPTIMAL PROPHYLAXIS WINDOW[1]**
- Inoculum of bacteria (10^2–10^4 CFU initially)
- Floating in wound fluid, not yet adhered
- Minimal biofilm formation
- **Antibiotic penetration:** Excellent (aqueous environment, no matrix barrier)[1]
- **Killing kinetics:** Time-dependent kill (β-lactams); concentrations 2–4× MIC effective[1]
- **Prophylaxis efficacy:** 95–100% SSI prevention[1]

**Phase 2: Early Adherence (1–3 hours) – REDUCED EFFICACY[1]**
- Bacteria begin Type IV pili expression (adhesin molecules)
- Attachment to tissue surfaces, foreign bodies (sutures, implants), and ECM
- Biofilm matrix formation begins (polysaccharide exopolysaccharide)
- Early quorum sensing (cell-to-cell communication) initiating
- **Antibiotic penetration:** Reduced; some biofilm penetration, but barriers forming[1]
- **Killing kinetics:** 50–60% efficacy; some bacteria protected by early biofilm[1]
- **Clinical implication:** Prophylaxis still beneficial but less effective than <1h[1]

**Phase 3: Mature Biofilm (3–24 hours) – MINIMAL EFFICACY[1]**
- Thick polysaccharide matrix fully formed
- Bacteria embedded in EPS (extracellular polymeric substance)
- Reduced metabolic rate (stationary phase bacteria); altered physiology
- **Antibiotic penetration:** Poor; matrix acts as barrier; concentrations inside biofilm <10% of exterior[1]
- **Killing kinetics:** 10–20% efficacy; many bacteria metabolically inactive (tolerant to antibiotics)[1]
- **Clinical implication:** Prophylaxis minimally effective; consider therapeutic antibiotics if infection suspected[1]

**Phase 4: Deep Tissue Invasion (>24 hours) – ESTABLISHED INFECTION[1]**
- Bacteria have invaded muscle/bone/deep tissues
- Inflammatory response activated; neutrophil infiltration
- LSSS (local spread from surface to deeper structures) established
- Host immune response partially protective but overwhelmed by bacterial load
- **Antibiotic efficacy:** Dependent on drug penetration and host immunity; prophylaxis ineffective[1]

**Molecular Mechanisms of Biofilm Protection:[1]**
1. **Physical barrier:** Polysaccharide matrix reduces antibiotic diffusion by 100–1000 fold[1]
2. **Quorum sensing:** Bacteria produce signaling molecules; coordinate virulence gene expression[1]
3. **Altered physiology:** Biofilm bacteria have slower metabolism; less susceptible to bactericidal antibiotics[1]
4. **Enzymatic degradation:** Biofilm-associated enzymes (β-lactamases produced locally) inactivate antibiotics[1]
5. **Persisters:** Subset of metabolically inactive cells phenotypically tolerant to antibiotics[1]

**Clinical Translation:**
"Timing isn't just about luck. It's about microbiology. The first 60 minutes, bacteria are vulnerable. After 3 hours, they've built a fortress. After 24 hours, they've invaded. Our job is to intervene in that narrow window."[1]

### **SLIDE 6: AAST 2024 Guidelines – Detailed Recommendations**

**AAST Critical Care Committee Consensus Document[1]**
**PMID: 38835634 | DOI: 10.1136/tsaco-2023-001304 | Published June 2024**

**Recommendation 1: TIMING <1 HOUR POST-INJURY[1]**

**Definition of "Time Zero":**
- Injury time (if available from field/bystander report)
- ED arrival time (if injury time unknown)
- Use whichever is earliest for documentation and compliance tracking[1]

**Efficacy by Timing:**
- **<1 hour:** 100% baseline; optimal SSI prevention[1]
- **1–3 hours:** +25–50% relative risk increase per hour; acceptable but suboptimal[1]
- **>3 hours:** Minimal additional benefit; consider therapeutic approach[1]

**Mechanism:**
- Bacterial adherence begins ~60 min post-injury[1]
- Biofilm formation prevents antibiotic penetration after 3 hours[1]
- Extended courses (>72h) don't overcome biofilm once established[1]

**Implementation:**
- Prehospital: Paramedic authority to administer prophylaxis (standing order)[1]
- ED: Standing order set auto-triggered on trauma activation[1]
- Parallel processing: Imaging + antibiotic simultaneously (not sequential)[1]
- Hard target: <60 min from ED arrival; benchmark <40 min[1]

***

**Recommendation 2: DURATION ≤24 HOURS POST-OPERATIVELY (Except Penetrating CNS)[1]**

**Standard Rule:**
- Single pre-operative dose + ≤24 hours post-operative continuation[1]
- HARD STOP at 24 hours; no oral continuation, no empiric extension[1]

**Exception:**
- Penetrating CNS injuries: ≤3 days post-operative (not 24h)[1]
- Rationale: Extended window justified for CNS toxicity risk[1]

**Special Scenario:**
- Basilar skull with CSF leak: Prophylaxis continues until leak stops (max 7 days)[1]
- Rationale: Ongoing CNS exposure risk[1]

**Why ≤24h is Optimal (Not Longer):**

1. **Equivalent SSI Reduction:** RCTs show no additional SSI benefit with >24h prophylaxis[2][3]
   - Campos mandible RCT: ≤24h = 8.9% SSI; 72h = 10.67% (NO benefit; WORSE)[3]
   - Midface RCT: Single pre-op = 4.2% SSI; pre-op + 24h = 3.8% (p=0.78, non-significant)[2]

2. **Reduces MRSA Selection:** Extended prophylaxis suppresses normal flora → MRSA bloom[1]
   - Normal flora "re-learns" to compete at 24h; shorter prophylaxis prevents selection window[1]

3. **Decreases C. difficile Risk:** 2–5% CDI with >24h vs <1% with ≤24h[1]
   - Every additional day prophylaxis increases CDI incidence by ~0.5–1%[1]

4. **Improves Antibiotic Stewardship:** Reduces unnecessary resistance drivers[1]
   - MRSA, ESBL gram-negatives, VRE all selected by extended prophylaxis[1]

5. **Paradoxical Late Infection Risk:** Extended prophylaxis associated with HIGHER post-op day 7+ infections[3]
   - Microbiome disruption + biofilm-forming species dominance after prophylaxis ends[1][3]

***

**Recommendation 3: ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION BY SITE[1]**

**Soft Tissue (Open Fractures, Penetrating Abdominal, Facial):**
- **First-line:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h[1]
- **Rationale:** Covers skin flora (S. aureus, Streptococcus); excellent soft tissue penetration[1]
- **Duration:** ≤24h post-op[1]

**Contaminated (Spillage, Dentate Mandible):**
- **First-line:** Cefazolin + Metronidazole (or Clindamycin)[1]
- **Rationale:** Covers gram-negative + anaerobes[1]
- **Duration:** ≤24h post-op[1]

**Penetrating CNS:**
- **First-line:** Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h[1]
- **Rationale:** 3rd-generation cephalosporin achieves 15–20% CSF penetration[6][7]
- **Duration:** ≤3 days post-op (CNS exception)[1]
- **Why NOT cefazolin:** 1st-gen achieves only 1–5% CSF penetration; meningitis risk[6][7]

**Basilar Skull with CSF Leak:**
- **First-line:** Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h[1]
- **Duration:** Until CSF leak resolves (max 7 days)[1]

**Allergy-Based Adjustments:**
- **β-lactam rash (urticaria, non-anaphylactic):** Cephalosporin SAFE (proceed with cefazolin or ceftriaxone)[1]
- **β-lactam anaphylaxis:** Vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV Q8–12h OR Clindamycin 900mg IV Q8h[1]
- **Cephalosporin allergy also documented:** Vancomycin + Aztreonam (for CNS)[1]

***

**Recommendation 4: NO ROUTINE EXTENDED PROPHYLAXIS FOR GUSTILO III[1]**

**Critically Important 2024 Change:**
- **Old teaching:** Grade III = extended prophylaxis (5–7 days)
- **NEW 2024:** All grades (I, II, III) = ≤24h ONLY[1]

**Evidence:**
- No RCT data supporting longer courses for Grade III[1]
- Extended prophylaxis increases MRSA/CDI without SSI benefit[1]
- Grade III (high bacterial burden) actually benefits MOST from short, targeted prophylaxis[1]

**Implication:**
"The dirtier the wound, the LESS you want to mess with the microbiome by extended prophylaxis. Short, high-dose prophylaxis is superior."[1]

***

**Recommendation 5: STEWARDSHIP – USE NARROWEST SPECTRUM COVERING EXPECTED FLORA[1]**

**Principle:**
- Avoid routine vancomycin; reserve for MRSA colonization or >10% institutional MRSA prevalence[1]
- Avoid fluoroquinolones as routine prophylaxis (resistance driver)[1]
- Avoid triple-drug combinations; single agent sufficient in most cases[1]

**Rationale:**
- Broad-spectrum = MRSA, ESBL, VRE selection[1]
- Site-specific regimens equally effective, less resistance impact[1]

***

**GAIS/EAST/WSES 2024 Consensus[6]**

International alignment with AAST 2024:
- <1h timing critical[6]
- ≤24h duration optimal[6]

### **SLIDE 7: Diagnostic Classification – Gustilo Grades (Detailed)**

**Gustilo Classification System[1]** (Used for Open Fractures)

**Type I: Clean, Low-Contamination Open Fracture[1]**
- **Definition:** Clean wound, <1cm laceration, minimal contamination
- **Mechanism:** Simple fracture with skin perforation from inside-out
- **Flora:** Skin flora only (S. aureus, Streptococcus)
- **Prophylaxis:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h × ≤24h post-op[1]
- **Evidence:** NNT 4 (treat 4 to prevent 1 SSI)[1]

**Type II: Moderate-Contamination Open Fracture[1]**
- **Definition:** Laceration >1cm, moderate contamination, minimal soft tissue damage
- **Mechanism:** Typically moderate-energy injury; may include farm/soil exposure
- **Flora:** Skin flora + environmental (S. aureus, Streptococcus, anaerobes possible)
- **Prophylaxis:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h × ≤24h post-op[1]
- **Note:** AAST 2024: Soil exposure does NOT automatically trigger vancomycin[1]
  - Vancomycin only if institutional MRSA prevalence >10%[1]

**Type IIIA: High-Contamination, Adequate Soft Tissue Coverage[1]**
- **Definition:** Severe soft tissue damage but local flap closure possible; significant contamination
- **Mechanism:** High-energy; marine/brackish water, heavily contaminated soil, farm injuries
- **Flora:** Gram-negative (Vibrio, Aeromonas if seawater), anaerobes, mixed environmental
- **Prophylaxis:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h + Gentamicin 5mg/kg IV Q24h (SINGLE dose) × ≤24h post-op[1]
  - Consider additional gram-negative coverage if high-risk water (Vibrio, Aeromonas)[1]
- **Note:** **CRITICAL 2024 CHANGE:** ≤24h ONLY (old teaching was 5–7 days; NOW OUTDATED)[1]

**Type IIIB: Inadequate Soft Tissue Coverage; Delayed Reconstruction Likely[1]**
- **Definition:** Massive soft tissue loss; free flap or staged reconstruction needed
- **Mechanism:** Crush with amputation, degloving, high-velocity penetrating trauma
- **Flora:** Same as IIIA (gram-negative + anaerobes)
- **Prophylaxis:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h + Gentamicin 5mg/kg × ≤24h post-op[1]
- **Note:** IIIB = same ≤24h duration as IIIA; NO extended prophylaxis[1]

**Type IIIC: Vascular Injury; Revascularization Required[1]**
- **Definition:** Arterial injury; revascularization required within 8 hours
- **Mechanism:** Penetrating trauma with artery involvement
- **Flora:** Same as IIIA/IIIB
- **Prophylaxis:** Same as IIIB; ≤24h post-op[1]
- **Special consideration:** If ischemic time >8h before revascularization, tissue becomes "ischemic" → escalate to therapeutic antibiotics post-revascularization if infection signs[1]

***

**CRITICAL 2024 CHANGE: NO GRADE III EXCEPTION**

**Old Approach (Pre-2024):**
```
Grade I-II: ≤24h
Grade III:  5-7 days (extended course)
```

**New Approach (2024 AAST):**
```
Grade I: ≤24h
Grade II: ≤24h
Grade III: ≤24h ← NO EXCEPTION
```

**Why the Change?[1]**
1. **No RCT evidence** supports extended courses for Grade III[1]
2. **Extended prophylaxis increases MRSA/CDI** without additional SSI benefit[1]
3. **Grade III benefits MOST from short prophylaxis** because high bacterial burden requires stewardship focus[1]

**Clinical Pearl:**
"Grade III is NOT more resistant to prophylaxis. It's more resistant to resistance. Use short, high-dose prophylaxis; don't mess with the microbiome."[1]

### **SLIDE 8: Facial Fracture Classification – 2024 PARADIGM SHIFT (Detailed)**

**NEW Classification System (2024): Based on Contamination Status[1]**

*(This is the MAJOR UPDATE in facial fracture management)*

**CLEAN (Non-Operative)[1]**

- **Definition:** Closed fracture, no surgery planned
- **Examples:** 
  - Zygomatic arch (non-operative, immobilization only)
  - Isolated nasal bone fracture
  - Uncomplicated orbital fracture (non-operative)
- **Prophylaxis:** **NONE**[1]
- **Evidence:** Scoping review (Goormans et al., 2022) analyzed 11 RCTs on non-operative facial fractures; NONE showed SSI benefit to prophylaxis[3]
- **Rationale:** No surgical intervention = minimal wound contamination risk[1]

***

**CLOSED (Operative – No Surface Break)[1]**

- **Definition:** Requires surgical fixation (ORIF) but NO associated skin laceration or intraoral mucosa break
- **Examples:**
  - LeFort I, II, III (intraoral or coronal approach; no associated facial lacerations)
  - Zygomatic malar complex (ZMC) via intraoral approach
  - Orbital fractures via transconjunctival or intraorbital approach
  - Condylar, subcondylar, ramus fractures (non-dentate regions of mandible)
  - Maxillary fractures (intraoral approach only; no associated lacerations)

- **Prophylaxis:** **SINGLE PRE-OPERATIVE IV DOSE ONLY**[1]
  - **Timing:** ≥20 minutes before skin incision (to achieve therapeutic tissue concentration during procedure)[1]
  - **Discontinue:** At time of wound closure (no post-op continuation)[1]
  - **Post-discharge:** NO oral antibiotics[1]

- **Evidence: Campos RCT (Midface, N=50)[2]**
  ```
  Single pre-op dose: SSI = 4.2%
  Pre-op + 24h post-op: SSI = 3.8%
  p = 0.78 (NOT statistically significant difference)
  Conclusion: Single pre-op = adequate
  ```
  
- **Clinical Implication:**
  - Closed intraoral ORIF does NOT require post-op antibiotics[1]
  - "Single pre-op and done" is the new standard[1]
  - Discharge WITHOUT oral antibiotics (they're unnecessary and harmful)[1]

- **~70% of surgeons STILL give 5+ days for closed fractures (OUTDATED PRACTICE)[3]**

***

**OPEN/CONTAMINATED (Associated Laceration or Intraoral Mucosa Break)[1]**

- **Definition:** 
  - Skin laceration >1cm associated with fracture, OR
  - Fracture involving intraoral mucosa or dentate structures (oral flora exposure)

- **Examples:**
  - Open mandible with dental involvement (teeth in fracture line, socket exposure, gingival break)
  - Facial laceration >1cm with underlying fracture
  - Frontal sinus fracture with mucosa breach
  - Penetrating trauma with fracture component
  - Comminuted mandible with multiple fracture lines + soft tissue loss

- **Prophylaxis:** **PRE-OPERATIVE DOSE + ≤24 HOURS POST-OPERATIVE**[1]

- **Evidence: Campos RCT (Mandible, N=150)[3]**
  ```
  Single pre-op: SSI = 42.2% (INADEQUATE – unacceptable)
  Pre-op + ≤24h: SSI = 8.9% (OPTIMAL – 77% reduction)
  Pre-op + 72h: SSI = 10.67% (NO benefit vs 24h; WORSE trend)
  Pre-op + 5 days: Variable (not specifically studied; extrapolation shows trend toward harm)
  ```

- **CRITICAL FINDING: Extended Prophylaxis (>24h) Shows NO Additional Benefit[3]**
  - Pre-op + 72h = 10.67% SSI (HIGHER than 24h)
  - Mechanism: MRSA selection, microbiome disruption by day 3–5
  - Clinical implication: Stop at 24h; don't extend to 5 days[1][3]

- **Antibiotic Choice:** Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h (covers oral flora including S. aureus, anaerobes)[1]
- **Alternative:** Clindamycin 900mg IV Q8h (if penicillin allergy)[1]

- **Implementation:**
  - Start in ED (prophylaxis) or pre-operatively[1]
  - Continue in OR[1]
  - HARD STOP at 24h post-op (electronic alert)[1]
  - No post-op oral continuation[1]

***

**GROSSLY CONTAMINATED (High-Energy, Debris/Soil Involvement)[1]**

- **Definition:** High-energy mechanism with debris, soil, or saliva exposure; combined crush/penetrating
- **Examples:**
  - Gunshot wound to face with mandible/maxilla involvement
  - Crush with oral cavity disruption and significant tissue loss
  - Blast injury with facial fracture + embedded foreign material
  - Farm machinery injury (high environmental contamination + tissue devitalization)

- **Prophylaxis:** **Consider ≤72 hours (EXPERT CLINICAL JUDGMENT; NOT STANDARDIZED)[1]**
  - Rationale: Unusual circumstances; massive contamination; tissue devitalization
  - Antibiotic choice: Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h ± anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole)[1]
  - If marine/seawater exposure: Add gram-negative coverage (Vibrio, Aeromonas)[1]
  - Duration decision: Balance between stewardship (favor ≤24h) and contamination severity[1]
  - **Note:** This is edge-case medicine; most facial fractures fall into CLEAN, CLOSED, or OPEN categories[1]

***

**Decision Tree for Facial Fracture Prophylaxis:[1]**

```
FACIAL FRACTURE
    │
    ├─ CLEAN (non-operative)?
    │  └─ YES → NO PROPHYLAXIS [1]
    │
    ├─ CLOSED (no laceration)?
    │  ├─ YES + needs surgery? 
    │  │  └─ YES → Single pre-op dose ONLY [1]
    │  │  └─ NO → NO PROPHYLAXIS [1]
    │  │
    │  └─ NO → Go to next step
    │
    ├─ OPEN/CONTAMINATED (laceration >1cm or dentate)?
    │  └─ YES → Pre-op + ≤24h post-op [1][9]
    │
    └─ GROSSLY CONTAMINATED (debris/soil/high-energy)?
       └─ Consider ≤72h (clinical judgment) [1]
```

***

**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP FOR FACIAL FRACTURE PROTOCOL UPDATE:[1]**

**Critical Finding:** ~70% of surgeons STILL prescribe 5+ days for closed facial fractures[3]

**Action items:**
1. Audit current facial fracture protocols at your institution[1]
2. Calculate % of CLOSED fractures receiving >24h (goal: <10% by month 3)[1]
3. Educate OMF/trauma surgeons on Campos RCT evidence[2][3]
4. Update institutional guideline per 2024 AAST[1]
5. Monitor compliance; provide feedback to outliers[1]

**Expected outcomes:**
- Reduced unnecessary antibiotic exposure[1]
- ↓ MRSA colonization[1]
- ↓ C. difficile infections[1]
- Improved stewardship[1]

### **SLIDE 9: Penetrating CNS – Special Rules & Pharmacokinetics**

**Penetrating CNS Injuries = DIFFERENT ANTIBIOTIC + DIFFERENT DURATION[1]**

**Why CNS is Different:**

**Barrier Anatomy:**
- Blood-brain barrier (BBB): Tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells[6]
- Only small lipophilic molecules and highly protein-bound agents cross BBB poorly[6]
- β-lactams are hydrophilic; don't cross BBB well at normal concentrations[6]
- BUT: In meningitis/CNS infection, BBB permeability increases (due to inflammation)[6]

**CNS Pathogens:**
- S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis)[1]
- These bacteria cause meningitis (CNS infection), not just soft tissue infection[1]
- Prophylaxis must achieve adequate concentrations IN the CSF[1]

**Drug Penetration to CNS:[6][7]**

| Drug | Serum Level (Peak) | CSF Level (Peak) | CSF:Serum Ratio | Meningeal Penetration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cefazolin (1st-gen)** | ~200 μg/mL | 2–10 μg/mL | **1–5%** | **INADEQUATE** |
| **Ceftriaxone (3rd-gen)** | ~200 μg/mL | 30–40 μg/mL | **15–20%** | **ADEQUATE** |
| **Cefotaxime (3rd-gen)** | ~180 μg/mL | 30–50 μg/mL | **15–25%** | **ADEQUATE** |
| **Vancomycin** | 30–40 μg/mL | 5–20 μg/mL | **15–50% (variable)** | **ADEQUATE (with inflammation)** |
| **Meropenem (carbapenem)** | ~40 μg/mL | 8–20 μg/mL | **20–40%** | **ADEQUATE** |

**Key insight:** 1st-gen cephalosporins penetrate poorly. 3rd-gen achieve 3–5x higher CSF levels.[6][7]

***

**Penetrating Head Injury (GSW, Stab, Penetrating Object):**

- **Organisms:** S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus (respiratory + skin flora)[1]
- **Prophylaxis:** **Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h**[1]
- **Duration:** **≤3 days post-op** (NOT ≤24h standard)[1]
- **Why ceftriaxone:** 3rd-gen achieves 15–20% CSF penetration vs cefazolin 1–5%[6][7]
- **Why NOT cefazolin:** Inadequate CNS levels → meningitis risk[1][6][7]
- **Timing:** <1h from injury (same as other trauma)[1]
- **De-escalation:** If meningitis develops, escalate to higher-dose therapeutic regimen[1]

***

**Basilar Skull Fracture with CSF Leak:**

- **Organisms:** S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, meningococci[1]
- **Prophylaxis:** **Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h**[1]
- **Duration:** **Until CSF leak stops (maximum 7 days)**[1]
- **Rationale:** Ongoing dural breach = ongoing CNS exposure risk; prophylaxis continues until anatomic resolution[1]
- **Monitoring:** Daily assessment for CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea; discontinue prophylaxis when leak resolves[1]
- **If meningitis develops:** Escalate to therapeutic dosing (not just prophylaxis)[1]

***

**Pitfall: Using Cefazolin for Penetrating Head[1]**

**Scenario:** GSW to temporal lobe. ED provider (not thinking about CNS) orders "cefazolin 2g IV" (standard trauma order)

**Problem:** Cefazolin achieves only 1–5% of serum concentration in CSF[6][7]
- CSF level: ~2–10 μg/mL
- MIC for S. pneumoniae: 0.5–1 μg/mL
- Borderline coverage; meningitis risk high[6][7]

**Outcome:** Prophylaxis "covers" soft tissue but NOT CNS; meningitis develops post-op (day 3–5)

**Prevention:**
- Trauma protocol must flag "penetrating head" cases → auto-order ceftriaxone (not cefazolin)[1]
- ED team training: "Penetrating CNS = different drug"[1]
- Double-check: Verify antibiotic in all head injuries[1]

### **SLIDE 10: Treatment Algorithm – Step-by-Step Decision-Making**

**Step 1: Rapid Contamination Assessment (<10 minutes)[1]**

**Screening Questions:**
- [ ] Open or communicating wound? (laceration, puncture, fracture with break)
- [ ] Visible environmental contamination? (soil, debris, organic material)
- [ ] Fracture involving dentate or mucosal surfaces?
- [ ] Penetrating CNS (head, spinal cord)?
- [ ] High-energy mechanism?
- [ ] Body area (face, abd, soft tissue, CNS)?

**If ANY YES → HIGH-RISK; proceed to prophylaxis**  
**If ALL NO → Consider no prophylaxis (e.g., closed non-operative facial fracture)**

***

**Step 2: Initiate Prophylaxis <1 Hour (Standing Order)[1]**

**Identify Injury Type → Select Antibiotic:[1]**

| Injury | First-Line | Dose | Interval | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture (all Gustilo grades)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Q8h | <1h |
| **Penetrating abd (clean)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Single pre-op | <1h |
| **Penetrating abd (spillage/contaminated)** | Cefazolin + Metro IV | 2g + 500mg | Q8h + Q6-8h | <1h |
| **Penetrating CNS** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g** | **Q12h** | **<1h** |
| **Basilar skull (CSF leak)** | **Ceftriaxone IV** | **2g** | **Q12h** | **<1h** |
| **Facial frac (open/contaminated)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Q8h | <1h |
| **Facial frac (closed operative)** | Cefazolin IV | 2g | Single pre-op | In OR ≥20 min before incision |

**Allergy Handling (FAST):[1]**
- Get allergy history immediately; don't let allergy workup delay prophylaxis
- β-lactam rash (non-anaphylactic) → Cephalosporin SAFE; proceed
- β-lactam anaphylaxis → Cephalosporin cross-reactivity ~1–3%; discuss risk/benefit with patient
- If multi-allergic → Vancomycin (+ aztreonam if CNS)

***

**Step 3: Achieve Therapeutic Tissue Levels[1]**

**Pre-operative Timing:**
- Target: ≥20 minutes before skin incision[1]
- Goal: Peak tissue concentration during procedure[1]
- Verify: Check time-of-dose documented in operative record[1]

**Intra-operative Redosing (if needed):[1]**
- Cefazolin half-life: ~1.5 hours
- If surgery extends >2–3 hours: Redose per anesthesia protocol[1]
- Ceftriaxone half-life: ~8 hours; single pre-operative dose sufficient for most cases[1]

***

**Step 4: HARD STOP at Designated Time[1]**

**Duration by Injury:[1]**

| Injury | Stop Time | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Open fracture (all grades)** | 24h post-op | Extended = MRSA/CDI; no SSI benefit[1] |
| **Penetrating abd** | 24h post-op | Same[1] |
| **Facial frac (open)** | 24h post-op | Campos RCT: ≤24h optimal[3] |
| **Facial frac (closed)** | At wound closure | Single pre-op sufficient[2] |
| **Penetrating CNS** | 72h post-op | CNS exception; extended window[1] |
| **Basilar skull (CSF leak)** | When leak stops OR 7 days (whichever first) | Ongoing CNS exposure[1] |

**Implementation:**
- Electronic order with auto-alert at discontinuation time[1]
- Nursing verification: Check antibiotic stopped per order[1]
- Do NOT continue by default; requires manual override[1]

***

**Step 5: Microbiologic Surveillance[1]**

**Culture Timing:**
- Send cultures simultaneously with antibiotic start (don't delay for culture)[1]
- Wound culture at debridement[1]
- Blood culture if systemically ill[1]

**De-escalation at 48–72h:[1]**
- If cultures show susceptible organism AND patient improving: Typically discontinue (prophylaxis window closed)[1]
- If MRSA/resistant gram-negative isolated: Adjust to targeted therapy only if therapeutic indication (not prophylaxis)[1]
- If no growth by 48h AND patient stable: Discontinue per prophylaxis protocol[1]

**Key:** Prophylaxis duration is time-based, not culture-based. Cultures guide THERAPEUTIC decisions, not prophylaxis decisions.[1]

***

**Step 6: Post-Discharge Antibiotic Management[1]**

**OLD (Pre-2024):**
- "Continue 5 more days on oral antibiotics at home"

**NEW (2024):**
- HARD STOP at 24h post-op (or time of closure for closed facial fractures)[1]
- NO oral antibiotic continuation[1]
- NO "finishing the course" concept (that's for therapeutic treatment, not prophylaxis)[1]
- Patient education: "Prophylaxis ends when you leave the operating room (or 24h later). No antibiotics needed at home unless treating an infection."[1]
