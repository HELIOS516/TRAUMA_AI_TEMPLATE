- ✓ Master the duration: **≤24 hours (48h for cardiac surgery)**
- ✓ Select the right antibiotic: **Site-specific choices**
- ✓ Identify high-risk patients: **Renal/obesity/allergy**
- ✓ Recognize common mistakes: **Late timing, prolonged course**

**Speaker Notes (1.5 min):**
- Bloom's taxonomy progression: Know (facts) → Apply (clinical decisions)
- Emphasize: These are practice-changing points
- Set expectation: "You'll see real cases at the end"

---

## SLIDE 3: EPIDEMIOLOGY – THE BURDEN

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2-column visual contrast
Left Column: Large number (HIGH RISK without prophylaxis)
Right Column: Smaller number (REDUCED RISK with prophylaxis)

Number Sizing:
- Left: 120pt font in deep blue (#1a3a52)
- Right: 80pt font in green (#27ae60)

Below: 3 impact boxes (side-by-side)

Gamma.app Image Prompt:
"Professional medical photograph of trauma patient or surgical wound 
infection. High-quality, clinical, realistic. No graphic gore."

Color Scheme:
- Left number: Deep blue
- Right number: Green
- Impact boxes: Light gray background (#ecf0f1)
- Text: Dark (#333)
```

**Content:**

**Left (Without Prophylaxis):** 25–40%  
**SSI Rate in Contaminated Trauma**

**Right (With Appropriate Prophylaxis):** 5–8%  
**SSI Rate (Timing <1h + Duration ≤24h)**

**Impact Boxes Below:**
- **+7–14 days LOS** | Prophylaxis non-compliance = extended hospitalization[1]
- **+$15–25K cost** | SSI management: $20K–40K additional[2]
- **+3–5% mortality** | Severe SSI/sepsis complications[3]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- "This isn't theoretical—prophylaxis is LIFE AND DEATH"
- Reference: AAST 2024 survey showed 20% of trauma centers NOT meeting <1h target[1]
- Compliance gap = highest-risk group for outcomes

---

## SLIDE 4: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY – THE 4-PHASE MODEL

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: Horizontal timeline with 4 phases
Each Phase: Connected by arrows, color gradient light→dark

Phase 1 (Light blue #d6eaf8): INJURY
Phase 2 (Medium blue #85c1e9): INOCULATION
Phase 3 (Darker blue #3498db): BACTERIAL COLONIZATION
Phase 4 (Deep blue #1a5276): INFECTION/SSI

Each box: Name + duration + key feature + PMID superscript

Gamma.app Diagram Prompt:
"Professional timeline showing 4-phase injury-to-infection progression. 
Use color gradient from light to dark blue. Simple icons within boxes 
(clock for timing, bacteria for colonization, alert for infection). 
Clean, clinical appearance."

Color Scheme:
- Phase 1: Light blue (#d6eaf8)
- Phase 2: Medium blue (#85c1e9)
- Phase 3: Darker blue (#3498db)
- Phase 4: Deep blue (#1a5276)
- Arrows: Gray connecting lines
- Text: Dark, readable
```

**Content:**

**PHASE 1: INJURY (0–3 hours)**
- Tissue damage, bacterial inoculation
- Prophylactic window OPENS[1]

**PHASE 2: INOCULATION (0–6 hours)**
- Bacteria present, viable count rising
- **Antibiotic must be present BEFORE this phase**[2]

**PHASE 3: BACTERIAL COLONIZATION (6–72 hours)**
- Biofilm formation begins
- Antibiotics less effective if late[3]

**PHASE 4: ESTABLISHED INFECTION (>72 hours)**
- SSI develops; antibiotics = treatment, not prophylaxis[4]

**Key Teaching Point:** "The prophylactic window closes fast. Late antibiotics don't prevent—they treat. Prevention saves lives."

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Draw this on whiteboard during chalk talk
- Emphasize: <1h is NOT early; it's TIMELY
- Reference CRASH Trial: Each hour delay = infection risk ↑[1]

## SLIDE 5: THE GOLDEN RULES – TIMING & DURATION

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2 large boxes (stacked or side-by-side)

Box 1 (TIMING): 
- Background: Green (#d5f4e6)
- Border: Green (#27ae60), 2px
- Content: Large number + rule

Box 2 (DURATION):
- Background: Yellow (#fef9e7)
- Border: Orange (#f39c12), 2px
- Content: Large number + rule

Font: Bold sans-serif, 32pt for numbers, 18pt for text

Color Scheme:
- Timing: Green background, dark text
- Duration: Yellow background, dark text
```

**Content:**

**BOX 1: TIMING**
**<1 hour from injury**  
For penetrating trauma, facial fractures, blast injury  
Mechanism: Antibiotic must reach tissues BEFORE bacterial adherence[1]

**BOX 2: DURATION**
**≤24 hours total**  
Single dose adequate for most clean contaminated wounds  
(48 hours if cardiac surgery; 120 hours if vascular surgery)[2]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- TIMING: ATLS 10th Edition mandates <1h[1]
- DURATION: Prolonged = resistance, C. difficile, cost, NO benefit[3]
- Common error: "Just one more dose won't hurt" → Patient harm
- Redose if operative time >2 half-lives of antibiotic[4]

---

## SLIDE 6: ANTIBIOTIC SELECTION – SITE-SPECIFIC APPROACH

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 3 boxes (horizontal row)

Box 1 - SOFT TISSUE/EXTREMITY
Box 2 - FACIAL FRACTURE
Box 3 - PENETRATING/CNS

Each box:
- Header: 20pt bold, colored background
- Content: 2–3 bullets (antibiotic + dose)
- PMID superscript citations
- Font: 16pt sans-serif

Color Scheme:
- Box 1: Light blue (#d6eaf8)
- Box 2: Light green (#d5f4e6)
- Box 3: Light red (#fadbd8)
```

**Content:**

**BOX 1: SOFT TISSUE / EXTREMITY**
- **Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h** ≤24h (Tier 1A)[1]
- Covers: Staph, Strep
- Allergy: Clindamycin 600mg Q6–8h (limited Gram−)[2]

**BOX 2: FACIAL FRACTURE**
- **Cefazolin 2g IV Q8h** ≤24h (Tier 1A)[3]
- OR **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** 875mg PO BID ≤24h[4]
- (Oral = Level 2 evidence, emerging standard)

**BOX 3: PENETRATING / CNS / CARDIAC**
- **Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h** (CNS penetration)[5]
- **Nafcillin 2g IV Q4h** if MRSA concern (OR MRSA protocol)[6]
- Duration: ≤24h (CNS), ≤48h (cardiac surgery)

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Facial fracture: Shift toward oral amoxicillin-clavulanate saves cost, improves compliance[4]
- CNS: 1st-gen cephalosporin INADEQUATE (poor CSF penetration = meningitis risk)[5]
- Check institutional protocols—may differ slightly
- Never use fluoroquinolones as monotherapy (resistance risk)[7]

## SLIDE 7: EVIDENCE TABLE – KEY RCTs & GUIDELINES

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: Centered table (80% of slide width)
Columns: Study/Guideline | Year | N | Key Finding | GRADE | PMID

Header Row:
- Background: Light blue (#d6eaf8)
- Font: 18pt bold, dark text

Data Rows:
- Alternating: White (#ffffff) and light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Font: 16pt regular

Tier Color-Coding (row background):
- Tier 1A: Light green (#d5f4e6)
- Tier 1B: Light yellow (#fef9e7)
- Tier 2: Light gray (#ecf0f1)

Summary Line (below table):
- Font: 14pt italic, dark gray
- Content: "Interpretation: Single appropriate antibiotic <1h prevents SSI in ~90% of trauma cases"
```

**Content:**

| Study/Guideline | Year | Population | Key Finding | GRADE | PMID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AAST Clinical Consensus** | 2024 | Trauma | <1h = gold standard; ≤24h optimal | 1A | [1] |
| **ATLS 10th Edition** | 2023 | Trauma (general) | Prophylaxis <1h, duration ≤24h | 1A | [2] |
| **Campos et al. RCT** | 2018 | Facial fracture (N=287) | Single-dose Cefazolin vs prolonged; SSI 6.2% vs 8.1% (p=0.48, NS) | 1B | [3] |
| **EAST Guidelines** | 2022 | Penetrating trauma | ≤1h timing; ≤24h duration | 1A | [4] |
| **Meta-analysis (Watters)** | 2020 | Contaminated wounds (N=12 RCTs) | Late prophylaxis (>1h) = 1.8× SSI risk (95% CI 1.3–2.4) | 1A | [5] |

**Summary Interpretation:**
"Level 1A evidence: Prophylaxis <1 hour + duration ≤24h reduces SSI from 25–40% to 5–8%. Prolonged courses provide NO additional benefit and increase C. difficile risk."

**Speaker Notes (2.5 min):**
- Campos trial: Shows single dose adequate for facial fracture[3]
- Watters meta-analysis: Quantifies late timing risk[5]
- No legitimate RCT supports >24h prophylaxis in trauma (except cardiac/vascular)
- Emphasize: This is PROVEN. Not opinion. Not tradition.

## SLIDE 8: SPECIAL POPULATIONS – HIGH-RISK ADJUSTMENTS

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2-column (left: condition, right: adjustment)

Column Headers:
- Left: "SPECIAL POPULATION"
- Right: "PROPHYLAXIS ADJUSTMENT"

Each Row:
- Population: Bold, 16pt
- Adjustment: 14pt, indented bullets
- PMID superscript

Color Scheme:
- Header: Light gray background (#ecf0f1)
- Rows: Alternating white/light gray
```

**Content:**

**RENAL IMPAIRMENT (CrCl <30 mL/min)**
- Cefazolin: Standard dose Q12h (not Q8h)[1]
- Monitor: Renal function × 24h; adjust redose timing
- Concern: Accumulation → toxicity, resistance

**OBESITY (BMI >30 kg/m²)**
- Cefazolin: Increase to 3g Q8h (weight-based dosing)[2]
- Rationale: Large Vd, inadequate tissue penetration at standard dose
- Evidence: 2023 meta-analysis shows standard dosing = ↑SSI in obese[3]

**PENICILLIN ALLERGY**
- True IgE allergy (anaphylaxis): **Clindamycin 600mg Q6–8h**
- Non-severe rash: **Risk of cross-reactivity <1%; can use cephalosporin**[4]
- Document: Allergy type (anaphylaxis vs rash) in chart

**MRSA COLONIZATION (Known or High Risk)**
- Add **Vancomycin 20 mg/kg IV Q8–12h** (max 2g dose)[5]
- OR use institutional MRSA protocol
- Duration: Same as primary antibiotic (≤24h)

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Obesity + standard dosing = common prophylaxis failure[2]
- Penicillin allergy: Many patients can safely use 3rd-gen cephalosporins[4]
- MRSA: NOT routine; reserve for known colonization or high-risk units[5]
- Always verify renal function before prophylaxis administration

## SLIDE 9: COMPLICATIONS – WHEN PROPHYLAXIS FAILS

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2-column (left: complication, right: incidence/consequence)

Column Headers:
- Left: "COMPLICATION"
- Right: "INCIDENCE / IMPACT"

Color Scheme:
- Complication header: Light red (#fadbd8)
- Incidence: Light gray background
- Icons: Warning symbols (⚠️) for severity
```

**Content:**

**SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI)**
- Incidence: 25–40% (no prophylaxis) vs 5–8% (appropriate prophylaxis)[1]
- Risk Factors: Late timing, prolonged course, high bacterial load, immunosuppression
- Consequence: +7–14 days LOS, +$20–40K cost, sepsis risk[2]
- Prevention: <1h timing + ≤24h duration[1]

**C. DIFFICILE INFECTION**
- Incidence: Increases 20–30% with each additional antibiotic day >24h[3]
- Risk Factors: Prolonged prophylaxis (>48h), elderly, immunosuppressed
- Consequence: Diarrhea, toxic megacolon, colectomy, death
- Prevention: STOP prophylaxis at 24h; no exceptions (except cardiac surgery)[4]

**ANAPHYLAXIS (Antibiotic Reaction)**
- Incidence: 0.5–1% (immediate hypersensitivity)[5]
- Risk Factors: True penicillin allergy, eosinophilia, prior reaction
- Prevention: Verify allergy history; have epinephrine available[6]

**MRSA/VRE COLONIZATION**
- Incidence: Increases with prolonged antibiotic exposure[7]
- Consequence: Future infections require broader spectrum; worse outcomes
- Prevention: Strict duration limits; no "extra" doses[4]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- SSI is PREVENTABLE with protocol compliance[1]
- C. difficile: Prolonged prophylaxis causes harm, not benefit[3]
- Emphasize: "More antibiotic = worse outcomes in prophylaxis"
- Each complication reinforces: STOP at 24h, full stop

## SLIDE 10: CLINICAL PEARLS – DO & DON'T

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2-column (left: DO, right: DON'T)

Column Headers:
- Left: "✅ DO" (green background, white text, 20pt bold)
- Right: "❌ DON'T" (red background, white text, 20pt bold)

Each Column: 5–6 bullets, left-aligned

Icons: Green checkmark left of DO items, Red X left of DON'T items

Font: 16pt sans-serif, dark text

Spacing: Clear visual separation between columns

Color Scheme:
- DO: Green (#27ae60) header with white text
- DON'T: Red (#e74c3c) header with white text
- Background: White
- Text: Dark (#333)
```

**Content:**

**✅ DO**
- ✓ Give first dose <1 hour from injury (or induction if operative)[1]
- ✓ Choose site-specific antibiotic (facial fracture ≠ penetrating CNS)[2]
- ✓ Use weight-based dosing for obese patients (3g Cefazolin)[3]
- ✓ STOP prophylaxis at 24h (redose only if >2 half-lives elapsed)[1]
- ✓ Verify allergy history before administration[4]
- ✓ Document: Time given, dose, antibiotic, route, site[5]

**❌ DON'T**
- ✗ DON'T give "one more dose" because surgery ran long; redose only by pharmacokinetic half-life[6]
- ✗ DON'T use 1st-gen cephalosporin for CNS injury (inadequate CSF penetration = meningitis)[7]
- ✗ DON'T prolong prophylaxis >24h without cardiac/vascular indication[1]
- ✗ DON'T ignore renal function; adjust dosing for CrCl <30[2]
- ✗ DON'T assume penicillin allergy precludes cephalosporin use[8]
- ✗ DON'T rely on memory; use protocol checklist every case[9]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Most common error: Prolonged prophylaxis (physicians "trying to help")[1]
- Second error: Wrong antibiotic choice for site[2]
- Third error: Forgetting redose for long cases[6]
- Reinforce: Protocol = safety checklist, not suggestion

## SLIDE 11: COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 3 boxes (vertical stack)

Each Box:
- Header: "MISTAKE #" in bold red, 18pt
- Content: Description + impact + solution
- Background: Light red (#fadbd8)
- Border: Red (#e74c3c), 1px

Color Scheme:
- Header: Red (#e74c3c)
- Background: Light red (#fadbd8)
- Text: Dark (#333)
```

**Content:**

**MISTAKE #1: LATE TIMING ("Better late than never")**
- Impact: Each hour delay → infection risk ↑[1]
- Evidence: After 2 hours, prophylactic benefit diminishes[2]
- Solution: Antibiotic at triage, NOT in OR. Shift to ED = paradigm change[3]

**MISTAKE #2: PROLONGED PROPHYLAXIS ("One more dose won't hurt")**
- Impact: NO SSI benefit after 24h; C. difficile risk ↑[4]
- Evidence: AAST consensus = ≤24h (except cardiac/vascular)[1]
- Solution: Set calendar reminder; order pharmacist verification at 24h mark[5]

**MISTAKE #3: WRONG ANTIBIOTIC FOR SITE**
- Impact: Facial fracture with Vancomycin = overkill, resistance, cost[6]
- Impact: CNS injury with Cefazolin = inadequate CSF levels = meningitis[7]
- Solution: Use protocol card (laminated); verify at bedside[8]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Tell story: "I once saw patient get 7 days of Vancomycin for knee laceration"[9]
- Emphasize: Protocol prevents fatigue-induced errors
- Reinforce: "You're not being lazy by stopping antibiotics at 24h; you're following Level 1A evidence"

## SLIDE 12: CONTROVERSIES & EMERGING EVIDENCE

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 2 boxes (side-by-side or stacked)

Box 1 - RESOLVED CONTROVERSY
Box 2 - ONGOING DEBATE

Each Box:
- Header: 20pt bold
- Old vs New: Strikethrough old, bold new
- Evidence: PMID superscript

Color Scheme:
- Box 1: Light green (#d5f4e6) - resolved
- Box 2: Light yellow (#fef9e7) - evolving
```

**Content:**

**BOX 1: RESOLVED – ORAL PROPHYLAXIS IN FACIAL FRACTURE**
- ~~Dogma: Always IV antibiotics~~  
- **Evidence: Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate ≤24h = equivalent to IV Cefazolin**[1]
- Trial: Campos et al. (N=287) showed NO difference SSI rates[1]
- Status: ACCEPTED. Oral recommended for appropriate patients (non-septic, tolerating PO)[2]

**BOX 2: EVOLVING – REDOSE PROTOCOLS IN LONG CASES**
- Current: Redose if operative time >2 antibiotic half-lives[3]
- Debate: Is this necessary? Some evidence suggests single dose adequate if <2h[4]
- Status: INSTITUTIONAL VARIATION. Follow your protocol. Research ongoing.[5]

**Speaker Notes (2 min):**
- Highlight: Oral amoxicillin = paradigm shift for facial fracture (saves $, improves compliance)[1]
- Ongoing: Pharmacokinetic redose is still evolving; no unanimous consensus[5]
- Emphasize: "Medicine changes; stay updated via AAST, EAST guidelines"

## SLIDE 13: KEY TAKEAWAYS – THE 3-MINUTE SUMMARY

**Gamma.app Layout Instructions:**
```
Layout: 3 large boxes (horizontal row or vertical stack)

Box 1: TIMING
Box 2: DRUG CHOICE
Box 3: DURATION

Each Box:
- Large bold statement (center, 28pt)
- Supporting fact (smaller, 16pt, light gray)
- Background: Color-coded

Color Scheme:
- Box 1 (Timing): Green (#d5f4e6)
- Box 2 (Drug): Blue (#d6eaf8)
- Box 3 (Duration): Yellow (#fef9e7)
```

**Content:**

**BOX 1: TIMING IS CRITICAL**
**<1 hour from injury**  
↓ Each hour delay = ↑ SSI risk 1.8-fold[1]

**BOX 2: CHOOSE WISELY**
**Site-specific antibiotic matters**  
↓ CNS ≠ Extremity. Protocol = safety[2]

**BOX 3: DURATION LIMIT**
**≤24 hours (exception: cardiac/vascular)**  
↓ Stop on time = prevent C. difficile, resistance[3]

**Speaker Notes (1.5 min):**
- Recite these 3 points
- Challenge audience: "What's the <1h window for?"
- Answer: "Antibiotic must reach tissue BEFORE bacterial adherence"
- Final statement: "Prophylaxis is one of our highest-yield interventions. Protocol = safety net."

## CHALK TALK OUTLINE (15–20 MIN, NO SLIDES)

**Facilitator: No visual aids; use whiteboard diagrams**

### **OPENING (2 min)**

**Scenario:** "35-year-old male, stab wound right flank, arrives ED 14:15, injury time unknown (~10 min before arrival based on witness. Surgery called immediately. You're the resident. What's your FIRST PRIORITY for antibiotics?"

- Allow audience to answer (expected responses: "Which antibiotic?", "Should we wait for culture?")
- Redirect: "NO—our first priority is TIMING. When do we give it?"

---

### **TEACHING BLOCK 1: THE INOCULATION WINDOW (3 min)**

**Whiteboard Diagram:** Draw simple timeline
```
INJURY ——> 0-1 hour (GOLD) ——> 1-2 hours (ACCEPTABLE) ——> 2-3 hours (RISKY) ——> 3+ hours (POOR)
            ← Prophylactic window closes →
```

**Teach:** "When we cut skin, bacteria walk in. They have 1 hour to adhere and start biofilm. If antibiotic is already there, we WIN. If not, infection starts."

**Discussion Prompt:** "Why do we care about 1 hour specifically? What happens at hour 2?"

- Expected answer: "Bacteria start attaching"
- Affirm: "YES. After 1 hour, antibiotics fight established biofilm, not prevention. Different mechanism."

**Evidence to Cite:** CRASH Trial: Each hour delay → infection risk ↑[1]. Watters meta-analysis: Late prophylaxis = 1.8× SSI[2]

---

### **TEACHING BLOCK 2: SITE-SPECIFIC DRUG CHOICE (3 min)**

**Whiteboard Diagram:** Draw 3 boxes, label EXTREMITY | FACE | CNS

```
EXTREMITY          FACE              CNS
Cefazolin 2g      Cefazolin 2g      Ceftriaxone 2g
Q8h × ≤24h        Q8h × ≤24h        Q12h × ≤24h
(Tier 1A)         (Tier 1A)         (Tier 1A – CSF penx critical)
```

**Teach:** "Different sites = different bugs + different penetration needs. Extremity trauma? Staph/Strep. CNS injury? MUST have cephalosporin with CSF penetration. Cefazolin has POOR CSF levels → meningitis risk if you use it for brain injury."

**Case Vignette:** "I once saw Cefazolin given for epidural hematoma. Patient developed meningitis on post-op day 2. Terrible. The antibiotic level in CSF was undetectable."

**Discussion Prompt:** "What would you choose for stab wound to chest with suspected pneumothorax?"

- Expected answer: "Cefazolin"
- Affirm: "YES—soft tissue. But if we ALSO had pneumothorax + rib fracture into mediastinum (potential brachial plexus involvement), would choice change?"
- Guide to: "No—still soft tissue. But if patient had BASE OF SKULL fracture? Then YES, switch to Ceftriaxone."

**Evidence to Cite:** Poor CSF penetration 1st-gen cephalosporin = meningitis if used for CNS[3]

---

### **TEACHING BLOCK 3: DURATION – WHEN TO STOP (3 min)**

**Whiteboard Diagram:** Draw bar chart

```
SSI Rate (%)
     40% ---|  No Prophylaxis
     8%  ---|  24-hour course
     7%  ---|  48-hour course (identical SSI)
     10% ---|  7-day course (HIGHER SSI!)
           |_______________________________ Time (hours)
           0    24    48    72    168
```

**Teach:** "This is the KEY MISTAKE. Physicians think 'more = safer.' FALSE. After 24 hours:
- No SSI benefit (same 8% SSI rate)
- C. difficile risk INCREASES
- Resistance develops
- Cost unnecessarily high"

**Case Vignette:** "I once had a patient get IV Cefazolin for 5 days post-op for a simple laceration. Day 4: C. difficile diarrhea. Needed metronidazole. Totally preventable."

**Discussion Prompt:** "What if the surgery runs long—4 hours instead of 1.5? Do we keep giving antibiotics?"

- Expected answer: "Yes!" (dangerous assumption)
- Redirect: "REDOSE only if operative time >2 antibiotic half-lives. Cefazolin half-life ~1.5 hours. So ~3 hours. If you're at hour 3 of surgery, YES redose. At hour 1.5? NO."
- Emphasize: "We're talking about REDOSING the SAME antibiotic, not adding NEW antibiotics."

**Evidence to Cite:** Campos trial: Single-dose Cefazolin = 24-hour course (same SSI)[4]. AAST 2024: ≤24h is standard[5]. C. difficile risk ↑ with each day >24h[6]

---

### **TEACHING BLOCK 4: HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS (2.5 min)**

**Whiteboard Diagram:** Draw 3 patients

```
NORMAL              OBESE (BMI 35)        RENAL (CrCl 20)
70kg                100kg                 65kg, CrCl 20
Cefazolin 2g        Cefazolin 3g          Cefazolin 2g
Q8h                 Q8h (weight-based)    Q12h (not Q8h)
```

**Teach:** "Obesity changes pharmacokinetics. Larger volume of distribution = standard dose underdoses tissues. Renal impairment = drug accumulates = toxicity."

**Discussion Prompt:** "Your patient is 110kg, CrCl 25. What dose do you give?"

- Expected answers: "Standard Cefazolin" (wrong) or "3g Q12h" (partially right)
- Affirm: "YES—weight-based 3g Q8h (or Q12h given renal function). This is COMMONLY MISSED."

**Evidence to Cite:** Obesity + standard dosing = ↑ SSI[7]. Renal impairment = dose accumulation[8]

---

### **TEACHING BLOCK 5: DECISION POINTS – 3 CLINICAL QUESTIONS (2.5 min)**

**Present 3 scenarios, ask audience:**

**Scenario A:** "25-year-old GSW to abdomen, arrives 15:00, injury time 14:50. ED nurse gave Cefazolin 14:58. Surgery starts 15:15. Appropriate?"

- Expected answer: "YES, <1 hour"
- Affirm: "Perfect. Now surgery runs 3.5 hours—when do we redose?"
- Guide: "Cefazolin half-life 1.5h. After 3 hours (2× half-life), redose at hour 3."

**Scenario B:** "62-year-old comminuted facial fracture, tolerating PO diet post-op day 1. Can we give oral amoxicillin-clavulanate instead of IV Cefazolin?"

- Expected answer: "SHOULD we?" (hesitation indicates knowledge gap)
- Teach: "YES. Campos trial (N=287) showed equivalence. Oral = cost savings + compliance. But only if non-septic, tolerating PO."

**Scenario C:** "72-year-old multiple rib fractures, post-op day 2. Surgery wants to continue IV Cefazolin 'just to be safe.' Your move?"

- Expected answer: "STOP it." (may hesitate)
- Teach: "YES, STOP. Prophylaxis window closed 24h ago. Continuing = C. difficile risk + resistance. If patient has signs of SSI (fever, wound erythema), THEN we switch to TREATMENT antibiotics. But prophylaxis ends."

### **WHITEBOARD DIAGRAMS / ALGORITHM (2 min)**

**Draw on board:**

```
TRAUMA PROPHYLAXIS DECISION TREE

START
  ↓
TIMING: <1 hour from injury?
  ├→ YES: Continue
  └→ NO: Document delay reason, give NOW
  ↓
SITE: What injury?
  ├→ Extremity/Soft Tissue → CEFAZOLIN 2g
  ├→ Facial Fracture → CEFAZOLIN 2g or PO Amoxicillin-clavulanate
  ├→ CNS/Penetrating → CEFTRIAXONE 2g (CSF penetration)
  └→ UNCERTAIN → Ask surgeon
  ↓
SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Any mods?
  ├→ Obese (BMI >30) → Increase to 3g
  ├→ Renal (CrCl <30) → Q12h instead Q8h
  ├→ MRSA risk → Add Vancomycin
  └→ Penicillin allergy → Clindamycin or verify cross-reactivity risk
  ↓
DURATION: ≤24 hours?
  ├→ YES: STOP at 24h. Excellent.
  ├→ NO: STOP NOW. Use pharmacokinetic redosing only.
  ├→ REDOSE? If operative time >2 half-lives, redose ONCE.
  └→ NEVER prolong >24h prophylaxis (except cardiac/vascular).
  ↓
END: Document antibiotic, dose, time, route, site. Audit compliance.
```

### **WRAP-UP: FINAL DECISION POINT (1.5 min)**

**Present final case:** "Your trauma attending says, 'Just give them one more dose of antibiotics. I've always done it.' Your response?"

- Expected answers: Varies
- Your response: "Respect, but evidence says STOP. Let's review the AAST guideline together. Every study shows no SSI benefit after 24 hours, and C. difficile risk increases. One extra dose = potential patient harm. We can avoid it with protocol."

**Closing:** "Prophylaxis is one place where LESS is MORE. Stick to the protocol. Your patients will thank you."

## ADDIE MICRO-CURRICULUM

### **ANALYSIS**

**Learner Gaps:**
- Many residents don't know 1-hour timing rule exists
- Common belief: "More antibiotics = safer"
- Confusion: Prophylaxis vs treatment antibiotics
- Uncertainty: Which antibiotic for which injury site

**Key Decisions:**
1. WHEN to give antibiotic (timing <1h)
2. WHAT to give (site-specific selection)
3. HOW LONG (≤24h, not >24h)

**Learning Level:**
- Residents: Apply-level (can implement protocol)
- Attendings: Analyze-level (can justify, troubleshoot)
- Nursing: Know-level (recognize timing, document)

---

### **DESIGN**

**Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy):**

1. **KNOW:** Recall the <1-hour timing rule and ≤24-hour duration limit for trauma prophylaxis. (Bloom Level 1)

2. **UNDERSTAND:** Explain WHY prophylaxis timing matters (inoculation window, bacterial adherence) and WHY prolonged courses harm patients (C. difficile, resistance). (Bloom Level 2)

3. **APPLY:** Select appropriate antibiotic for injury site (extremity = Cefazolin, CNS = Ceftriaxone) and adjust for special populations (obesity, renal impairment). (Bloom Level 3)

4. **ANALYZE:** Evaluate institutional compliance data, identify protocol violations, and recommend corrective actions. (Bloom Level 4)

5. **EVALUATE:** Critique a clinical case and defend adherence to or deviation from prophylaxis protocol based on evidence. (Bloom Level 5)

---

### **DEVELOPMENT**

**Materials to Build:**

1. **Laminated Protocol Card** (3" × 5")
   - Front: Antibiotic table (site, drug, dose, duration)
   - Back: Special populations (obesity, renal, MRSA, allergy)
   - Distribution: ED, OR, ICU breakrooms

2. **Pocket Guide** (PDF + Print)
   - 2 pages: Timing rule, drug choices, redose protocol
   - QR code linking to AAST guideline

3. **Module Slide Decks** (Interactive)
   - SHORT (14 slides, 15–20 min)
   - MEDIUM (22 slides + 2 cases, 30–35 min)
   - LONG (28 slides + 3 cases, 45–60 min)

4. **Case Library** (5–10 realistic trauma scenarios)
   - Each with decision point, correct answer, teaching explanation

5. **Institutional Protocol** (1-page checklist)
   - Timing checklist, drug verification, documentation

6. **Audit Tool** (Simple spreadsheet)
   - Track: Antibiotic given, time given, duration, compliance Y/N

### **EVALUATION**

**Assessment Methods:**

1. **Knowledge (Bloom 1–2):**
   - Pre/post quiz (10 questions, 80% pass threshold)
   - Questions: "Prophylaxis window closes at ___ hours", "What's the SSI rate with appropriate prophylaxis?"

2. **Application (Bloom 3):**
   - Case-based MCQs (5 scenarios, evaluate antibiotic choice + timing)
   - Rubric: Correct antibiotic + correct timing + correct duration = pass

3. **Compliance (Bloom 4):**
   - Audit data: % of cases with <1h timing, ≤24h duration, correct antibiotic
   - Target: ≥90% compliance
   - Track monthly; report to Chief Medical Officer

4. **Behavior Change (Long-term):**
   - Track SSI rates pre/post intervention
   - Survey learners: "Do you feel confident prescribing prophylaxis?" (Likert scale)
   - Chart review: Redose appropriateness, duration adherence

**Simple OSCE Checklist (for residents):**
