### Topic 9
#### (SHORT: 12 slides | MEDIUM: 18 slides | LONG: 24 slides)

***

## SHORT VERSION (12 SLIDES, 15–20 MIN)

### **SLIDE 1: Title Slide**
- **Title:** Spinal Cord Injury: Neurogenic Shock, Critical Care, & Recovery
- **Subtitle:** From Field to ICU – Evidence-Based Management 2024–2025
- **Setting:** Level 1 Trauma Center

***

### **SLIDE 2: SCI Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- **Incidence:** ~54 cases per million per year (US) [32][33]
- **Mechanism:** Motor vehicle crashes (35%), falls (28%), violence (24%), sports (8%) [34]
- **Neurogenic shock** (35% of SCI patients):
  - Occurs in **cervical/upper thoracic SCI** (T5 and above) [33][34]
  - Loss of sympathetic tone → bradycardia + hypotension [33]
  - Vasodilation without tachycardia (unlike hypovolemic shock) [33]
- **Window of opportunity:** Early intervention (within 24 h) may improve outcomes [34]
- *Evidence: ACS/ENLS/Neurocritical Care Society guidelines*

***

### **SLIDE 3: Acute Neurogenic Shock: Recognition**
| **Finding** | **Typical Shock** | **Neurogenic Shock** |
|---|---|---|
| **HR** | ↑ (tachycardia) | ↓ (bradycardia) or normal |
| **BP** | ↓ (hypotension) | ↓ (hypotension) |
| **Skin** | Pale, clammy | Warm, dry |
| **Cap refill** | Delayed | Normal |
| **Mechanism** | Hypovolemia | Vasodilation (↓ SVR) |

- **Key distinction:** Bradycardia + hypotension = neurogenic shock until proven otherwise [33][34]
- **Mimics:** Spinal shock (flaccid paralysis below injury) ≠ neurogenic shock [33]
- *Evidence: Neurocritical care physiology*

***

### **SLIDE 4: MAP Targets in SCI: First Week is Critical**
- **Goal:** Maintain **MAP >85 mmHg** for first 7 days post-injury [32][33][34]
  - Higher MAP improves spinal cord perfusion [32]
  - Reduces secondary ischemic injury [33]
  - **RCT evidence:** MAP augmentation → improved neurologic recovery [35]
- **Age adjustments:** No current age-based modification (unlike TBI) [34]
- **Monitoring:** Continuous arterial line (consider early given neurogenic shock risk) [32]
- *Evidence: ACS Spine Guidelines, ENLS Protocol v5.0, recent RCTs*

***

### **SLIDE 5: Vasopressor Selection in SCI**
| **Drug** | **Injury Level** | **Mechanism** | **First-Line?** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phenylephrine** | Cervical/upper thoracic | Pure vasoconstriction | NO (↓ CO) |
| **Norepinephrine** | Cervical | Vaso + inotropic | YES ✓ |
| **Dopamine** | Upper thoracic (T1-T5) | Dose-dependent (see below) | Maybe |

- **Dopamine dosing:**
  - Low (2–4 μg/kg/min): Renal/splanchnic vasodilation
  - Medium (5–10 μg/kg/min): **Inotropic + mild vaso** → Often used in SCI [34]
  - High (>10 μg/kg/min): Vasoconstriction (avoid)
- **Best practice:** Start **norepinephrine** if MAP <85 mmHg despite fluid [32][33]
- *Evidence: ENLS Protocol, critical care physiology*

***

### **SLIDE 6: Fluid Resuscitation in SCI: Balance**
- **Initial:** Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation (hemorrhage control is priority) [32][34]
- **Ongoing (post-hemorrhage control):** **Judicious fluid** (avoid pulmonary edema) [32]
  - SCI → neurogenic shock (vasodilation, not hypovolemia)
  - Excess fluid doesn't improve MAP; vasopressors do [32][34]
- **Target:** Euvolemia (JVD, lung auscultation, UOP 0.5–1 mL/kg/h) [32]
- **CVP/PCWP monitoring:** Consider if hypotension refractory to fluids + vasopressors [32]
- *Evidence: ENLS, critical care guidelines*

***

### **SLIDE 7: Early Spinal Decompression**
- **Timing:** **Within 24 hours of injury** vs delayed (>24 h) [34][35]
- **Evidence:** Decompression within 24 h associated with:
  - Improved neurologic recovery (1–2 ASIA grade improvement) [34]
  - Shorter ICU stay [34]
  - Reduced respiratory complications [34]
  - **RCT:** 65% favorable outcome (within 24h) vs 52% (>24h) [35]
- **Operative approach:** Depends on injury anatomy (anterior, posterior, or both) [34]
- **Risk:** Anesthesia + operative time in unstable patient [34]
- *Evidence: ASIA Clinical Practice Guidelines, neurosurgery literature*

***

### **SLIDE 8: Respiratory Management in SCI**
- **High cervical (C1–C4):** Complete respiratory failure likely → mechanical ventilation [32][33]
- **Mid-cervical (C5–C8):** Variable; may require intubation for secretion mgmt [32]
- **Thoracic (T1–T5):** Often preserve intercostal innervation; lower risk [32]
- **Key:** Early tracheostomy (7–10 days) if prolonged ventilation anticipated [32]
  - Facilitates weaning, reduces VAP risk [32]
- **Abdominal binder:** Improves diaphragmatic mechanics in thoracic SCI [32]
- *Evidence: ENLS Protocol, respiratory physiology*

***

### **SLIDE 9: Thromboprophylaxis in SCI**
- **Risk:** Immobilization + injury → VTE incidence 60–80% (untreated) [32][33]
- **Prophylaxis approach:**
  - **Mechanical:** Sequential compression devices (SCDs) + early mobilization [32]
  - **Pharmacologic:** **Enoxaparin** (preferred) started within 24 hours of injury [32][33]
    - Dose: 30 mg SC BID (adjust for renal function)
    - Duration: **≥3 months** (long duration of risk) [33]
  - **Inferior vena cava filter:** Only if contraindication to anticoagulation [33]
- **Monitoring:** Duplex ultrasound if symptomatic [32]
- *Evidence: ACCP guidelines, SCI thromboprophylaxis trials*

***

### **SLIDE 10: Long-Term Outcomes & Rehabilitation**
- **Neurologic recovery:** ~50% of motor improvement occurs in first 3 months [34][36]
- **Plateau:** Most recovery complete by 1 year [34]
- **Functional outcomes:**
  - Incomplete SCI: Better prognosis (50–60% walk independently) [34]
  - Complete SCI: Limited ambulation (20–30% walk with assist) [36]
- **Rehabilitation:** Aggressive PT/OT from day 1 → improved outcomes [34]
- **Psychosocial:** PTSD, depression common; early screening recommended [34]
- *Evidence: SCI rehabilitation trials, long-term follow-up studies*

***

### **SLIDE 11: Clinical Pearls & Pitfalls**
**DO:**
- ✅ Maintain **MAP >85 mmHg** for 7 days post-injury (key intervention) [32][33]
- ✅ Use **norepinephrine** if fluid-refractory hypotension [32]
- ✅ Pursue **early decompression within 24 h** if operatively feasible [34][35]
- ✅ Initiate **thromboprophylaxis** within 24 hours [33]

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use phenylephrine alone in SCI (decreases CO, worsens perfusion) [32]
- ❌ Over-resuscitate with fluids (neurogenic shock ≠ hypovolemia) [32]
- ❌ Delay early mobilization (increases VTE, pneumonia risk) [32]
- ❌ Omit DVT prophylaxis (60–80% incidence untreated) [33]

## MEDIUM VERSION (18 SLIDES, 30–35 MIN)

[Keep all 12 SHORT slides, then ADD:]

***

### **SLIDE 13: SCI Classification & Prognosis**
- **ASIA Impairment Scale (A–E):**
  - **A (Complete):** No motor/sensory below injury → Poor ambulation prognosis [34]
  - **B (Sensory incomplete):** Sensory only → Better than A [34]
  - **C (Motor incomplete, <50% strength):** Moderate impairment [34]
  - **D (Motor incomplete, ≥50% strength):** Good prognosis [34]
  - **E (Normal):** Full recovery expected [34]
- **Neurologic levels (C1–T12, L1–S5):** Determine muscle function preserved [32][34]
- **Prognostication:** Within 72 hours, ASIA grade predicts long-term ambulation [36]
- *Evidence: ASIA classification system, prognostication studies*

***

### **SLIDE 14: ICU Monitoring in SCI Patients**
- **Arterial line:** Continuous MAP monitoring (target >85 mmHg) [32]
- **Cardiac monitor:** Watch for bradycardia (neurogenic reflex) [33][34]
- **Respiratory:** Vital capacity, ABGs (assess diaphragm function) [32]
- **Bowel/bladder:** Neurogenic dysfunction; intermittent catheter protocol [32]
- **Skin:** Pressure ulcer prevention (immobility risk, sensory loss) [32]
- **Temperature:** Poikilothermia (inability to thermoregulate); monitor closely [32]
- *Evidence: ENLS Protocol, ICU management guidelines*

***

### **SLIDE 15: Complications of SCI in ICU**
| **Complication** | **Incidence** | **Prevention** | **Treatment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VTE** | 60–80% | Enoxaparin + SCDs | Anticoagulation, IVC filter |
| **Pneumonia** | 30–50% | Early mobilization, VAP bundle | Antibiotics, respiratory support |
| **Pressure ulcers** | 20–30% | Frequent turning, specialty bed | Wound care, OR debridement |
| **Spasticity** | 70% (delayed) | Stretching, PT/OT | Baclofen, botox |
| **Autonomic dysreflexia** | 48–90% (if ≥T6) | Bowel/bladder management | BP control, identify trigger |

- *Evidence: SCI complication literature, ICU management studies*

***

### **SLIDE 16: Autonomic Dysreflexia: Recognition & Management**
- **Trigger:** Any stimulus below injury (distended bladder most common) [32][34]
- **Presentation:** Sudden **severe hypertension** (SBP >150), bradycardia, headache, flushing [32]
- **Risk:** Hypertensive emergency, stroke, MI if untreated [32][34]
- **Management:**
  1. **Sit upright** (gravity reduces BP) [32]
  2. **Loosen restrictive clothing/catheter** (remove trigger) [32]
  3. If SBP persistently >150: **Nifedipine** (immediate-release 10 mg PO) or **sodium nitroprusside** IV [32][34]
  4. Identify/remove trigger (usually urinary retention) [32]
- **Prevention:** Regular bladder drainage, bowel program [32][34]
- *Evidence: Neurocritical care protocols, autonomic physiology*

***

### **SLIDE 17: Nutrition & Metabolic Support**
- **Early enteral nutrition:** Within 24–48 hours post-injury (SCI = high catabolism) [32][34]
- **Protein goals:** 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day (higher than non-SCI trauma) [32]
- **Calories:** Goal 25–30 kcal/kg/day (hypermetabolic phase) [32]
- **GI dysfunction:** Ileus common first 24–48 h; prokinetics (metoclopramide) may help [32]
- **Prophylaxis:** H2 blocker or PPI (stress ulcer risk) [32]
- *Evidence: Nutrition support guidelines, SCI metabolism studies*

***

### **SLIDE 18: Special Considerations: Pregnancy & SCI**
- **Labor/delivery in SCI women:**
  - If injury >T6: Risk of autonomic dysreflexia during labor (life-threatening) [32][34]
  - Epidural anesthesia often needed to prevent dysreflexia [32]
- **Medication interactions:** Baclofen (spasticity), pain medications → monitor in pregnancy [34]
- **Counseling:** Pregnancy outcomes generally good with multidisciplinary care [34]
- *Evidence: OB/SCI specialized literature, limited RCT data*

***

## LONG VERSION (24 SLIDES, 45–60 MIN)

[Keep all 18 MEDIUM slides, then ADD:]

***

### **SLIDE 19: Detailed MAP Augmentation Strategy**
- **Days 1–7:** Maintain MAP >85 mmHg [32][33][35]
- **Mechanism:** Spinal cord ischemia secondary to swelling; higher MAP improves microcirculatory flow [32]
- **Approach:**
  1. **Fluids first:** Rapidly resuscitate to euvolemia (avoid under-filling) [32]
  2. **Vasopressor if needed:** Start norepinephrine (2–10 μg/min titrated to MAP) [32]
  3. **Monitor response:** Serial neuro exams, ICU course (ventilator days, infections) [35]
- **RCT evidence:** MAP augmentation (vs standard care) → fewer days intubated (6.8 vs 8.2 days) [35]
- **Cost:** ~$3000–5000 additional cost but improves neuro recovery [35]
- *Evidence: Randomized controlled trial (N=313), ENLS guidelines*

***

### **SLIDE 20: Case Vignette #1 – Early Recognition**
**Scenario:** 45-year-old female, fell down stairs, C6 fracture, arrives with BP 92/50, HR 48
- **Recognition:** Bradycardia + hypotension → **Neurogenic shock** [33][34]
- **Immediate steps:**
  1. Place central line (MAP monitoring) [32]
  2. Aggressive fluid bolus (1–2L crystalloid) [32]
  3. If MAP remains <85 mmHg → **Norepinephrine** IV [32]
  4. STAT neurosurgery consult (early decompression candidate?) [34]
- **Outcome:** MAP sustained >85 mmHg, decompressed within 18 h, improved ASIA grade by 1 level at 6 weeks [35]
- *Evidence: ENLS protocol application*

***

### **SLIDE 21: Case Vignette #2 – Long-Term Management**
**Scenario:** 28-year-old male, T5 SCI (complete), post-op day 3
- **Issues:**
  - DVT risk (immobile, SCI) – need prophylaxis [33]
  - Respiration adequate but prone to pneumonia – early mobilization? [32]
  - Spasticity emerging – medication strategy? [34]
  - Bowel dysfunction (neurogenic bowel) – management? [32]
- **Interventions:**
  - Enoxaparin 30 mg SC BID (7–10 days before transitioning to long-term) [33]
  - PT/OT involvement ASAP (bed mobility, transfer training) [34]
  - Baclofen initiation if spasticity interferes (start low, titrate slowly) [34]
  - Bowel program (digital stimulation, scheduled timing) [32]
- *Evidence: Comprehensive SCI ICU management*

***

### **SLIDE 22: Prognosis Counseling & Outcome Prediction**
- **Day 1 assessment:** ASIA grade + motor level → predict ambulation [36]
- **Prognostication accuracy:**
  - **Day 1 ASIA A (complete):** ~7% gain motor recovery, 20% ambulate [36]
  - **Day 1 ASIA D (motor incomplete, strong):** ~90% ambulate [36]
- **Avoid false hope:** Explain 50% recovery occurs in first 3 months, plateau by 1 year [34]
- **Rehabilitation intensity:** Aggressive therapy (6 h/day) vs. standard (3 h/day) → better outcomes [34]
- **Family discussion:** Realistic goals, long-term care planning, peer support [34]
- *Evidence: Prognostication studies, rehabilitation trials*

***

### **SLIDE 23: Discharge Planning & Continuity of Care**
- **Rehabilitation timing:** Transition to inpatient rehab when medically stable (day 7–14 typical) [32][34]
- **Multidisciplinary team:** Neurosurgeon, physiatrist, PT/OT, psychologist, case manager [34]
- **Community support:** Peer support groups, SCI associations (Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation) [34]
- **Long-term follow-up:** Annual urology screening (renal function, CA risk) [32]
- **Medications at discharge:** Enoxaparin (continue 3 months), baclofen, pain management [34]
- *Evidence: SCI rehabilitation guidelines, discharge planning literature*

***

### **SLIDE 24: Summary & Integration into Practice**
| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Key Actions** | **Evidence** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Acute (ICU)** | Days 1–7 | MAP >85, vasopressor if needed, early decompression | ENLS, RCT [32][35] |
| **Post-op** | Days 7–14 | DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin), mobilization, spasticity mgmt | ACCP, ENLS [33][32] |
| **Rehab** | Weeks 2–12 | Intensive PT/OT, family education, prognostication counseling | Rehab trials [34] |
| **Long-term** | Months 3–12+ | Community integration, long-term medication, annual urology | SCI literature [32] |

**BOTTOM LINE:** Early high MAP (>85 mmHg) + early decompression + aggressive rehabilitation = best neurologic outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis mandatory. Multidisciplinary coordination essential.

## CHALK TALK (15–20 MIN, NO SLIDES)

### **Opening Case:**
"56-year-old male, falls from ladder, C5 fracture. Arrives in ED: BP 88/52, HR 44, warm dry skin. What's happening?"

### **Teaching Block 1: Recognize Neurogenic Shock**
- **Draw on whiteboard:**
  ```
  C5 SCI
      ↓
  Loss of sympathetic tone (injury at C5)
      ↓
  Vasodilation + No tachycardia response
      ↓
  Bradycardia (vagal tone unopposed) + Hypotension
  = NEUROGENIC SHOCK
  ```
- **Ask resident:** "What's different from hemorrhagic shock?" 
  - Answer: **Bradycardia** (not tachycardia) + warm skin (not pale/clammy) [33]

### **Teaching Block 2: Immediate Management**
- **What do you do?**
  1. **Aggressive fluid** (1–2L crystalloid rapid) [32]
  2. **Central line** (monitor MAP) [32]
  3. **Vasopressor if MAP stays <85 mmHg** → **Norepinephrine** [32][33]
- **Why norepinephrine?** Combination of vasoconstriction + inotropic effect (better than pure vaso) [32]
- **Timeline:** This is a **time-sensitive neurosurgical emergency** [35]
  - **Early decompression (within 24 h) improves neurologic recovery** [34][35]

### **Decision Point #1: Intubate Now or Wait?**
- **Consider respiratory status:**
  - **C5:** Partial phrenic innervation; may have adequate diaphragm function [32]
  - **C1–C4:** Complete respiratory failure likely → intubate early [32]
  - **This patient (C5):** Monitor vital capacity; intubate if declining [32]
- **If intubating:** Early tracheostomy (day 7–10) if long-term vent likely [32]

### **Teaching Block 3: MAP >85 mmHg for First 7 Days**
- **Why 85?** Not 65 like other shock [32][33]
  - SCI → swelling compresses microcirculation [32]
  - Higher MAP "pushes through" the edema, improves blood flow [32]
  - Evidence: RCT shows fewer intubation days with MAP >85 [35]
- **Ask resident:** "How long do we maintain this?" → **7 days** [32][33][35]
  - After 7 days, goal shifts to standard MAP ≥65 [32]

### **Decision Point #2: Emergency Decompression or Stabilization First?**
- **Scenario:** C5 fracture, BP stable on pressors, but radiology shows cord compression [34][35]
- **Ask resident:** "Do we go to OR now or wait?"
  - **Answer:** **Within 24 hours** is supported by RCT evidence [34][35]
  - Early decompression → better neuro recovery (1–2 ASIA grades better) [34]
  - **Yes, proceed with early OR** (if medically stable enough) [35]

### **Teaching Block 4: Thromboprophylaxis**
- **Risk in SCI:** 60–80% develop DVT/PE if untreated [33]
- **Start:** Within 24 hours of injury [33]
- **Drug:** Enoxaparin 30 mg SC BID [33]
- **Duration:** **3 months** (much longer than other trauma) [33]
- **Monitoring:** Duplex ultrasound if symptomatic [33]

### **Teaching Block 5: Long-Term Outlook**
- **Ask resident:** "What's his prognosis at 1 year?"
  - **Depends on ASIA grade** (assessed at 24–72 hours) [36]
  - **C5, motor incomplete (partially preserved)** → **60–80% chance of ambulation** [34][36]
  - **C5, motor complete** → Limited ambulation (assisted only) [36]
- **Recovery timeline:** 50% improvement in first 3 months, plateau by 1 year [34]

### **Wrap-Up: Back to the Case**
"Your C5 SCI patient—BP 88, HR 44:
1. **Aggressive fluids** (neurogenic shock needs volume)
2. **MAP >85 mmHg** (7-day critical window for spinal cord perfusion)
3. **Norepinephrine** if fluid-refractory
4. **Neurosurgery STAT** (early decompression within 24h improves outcomes)
5. **Thromboprophylaxis** (enoxaparin 3 months)
6. **Early mobilization** (prevent pneumonia, VTE)"

**Ask residents:**
- "If he needs intubation, when do you do tracheostomy?" → Day 7–10 [32]
- "What triggers autonomic dysreflexia in SCI?" → Bladder distension, bowel impaction [32][34]
- "How does pregnancy change management?" → Higher dysreflexia risk in labor [32]
